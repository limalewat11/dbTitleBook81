Is identity merely a collection of electrical impulses? What separates us from animals, or from computers? </em><br><br>From Plato to <em>Westworld</em>, these questions have fascinated and befuddled philosophers, artists, and scientists for centuries. In <em>The Forgetting Machine</em>, neuroscientist Rodrigo Quian Quiroga explains how the mechanics of memory illuminates these discussions, with implications for everything from understanding Alzheimer's disease to the technology of Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>You'll also learn about the research behind what Quian Quiroga coined "Jennifer Aniston Neurons," cells in the human brain that are responsible for representing specific concepts, such as recognizing a certain celebrity's face. The discovery of these neurons opens new windows into the workings of human memory.<br><br>In this accessible, fascinating look at the science of remembering, discover how we turn perceptions into memories, how language shapes our experiences, and the crucial role forgetting plays in human recollection. You'll see how electricity, chemistry, and abstraction combine to form something more than the human brain, the human mind. And you'll gain surprising insight into what our brains can tell us about who we are.<br><br><em>The Forgetting Machine</em> takes us on a journey through science and science fiction, philosophy and identity, using what we know about how we remember (and forget) to explore the very roots of what makes us human.</p><p><strong>Rodrigo Quian Quiroga</strong> holds a Research Chair at the University of Leicester, UK.

She encourages a mutated hippo with a fiery temper to become a demolition worker instead of robbing banks, and she teams up with Chipmunk Hunk, Koi Boi, Loki (who, at the request of Nancy, transforms himself into "Cat Thor" from her Thor fan fiction), and the new and previous Thors in order to defeat Ratatoskr, the Norse God of Squirrels, whose influence makes heroes and ordinary citizens alike turn on one another. Squirrel Girl's incredible strength, intellect, and genuine interest in making friends make her an unbeatable heroine and a relatable role model.

With its early roots pertaining to occupational health in the interpreting field, DC-S has evolved into a holistic work analysis framework which guides interpreters in their development of ethical and effective decision-making skills. Adapted from Robert Karasek&#x2019;s demand control theory, this textbook is the culmination of nearly two decades of work, as it evolved over the course of 22 articles and book chapters and nine DC-S research and training grants. Designed primarily for classroom use in interpreter education programs (IEPs), interpreting supervisors, mentors, and practitioners also will find this book highly rewarding. IEPs could readily use this text in introductory courses, ethics courses, and in practicum seminars. Each of its ten chapters guides the reader through increasingly sophisticated descriptions and applications of all the key elements of DC-S, including its theoretical constructs, the purpose and method of dialogic work analysis, the schema&#x2019;s teleological approach to interpreting ethics, and the importance of engaging in reflective practice, especially supervision of the type that is common in other practice professions. Each chapter concludes with a class activity, homework exercises, a check for understanding (quiz), discussion questions, and an advanced activity for practicing interpreters. The first page of each chapter presents a list of the chapter&#x2019;s key concepts, preparing the reader for an efficient and effective learning experience. Numerous full-color photos, tables, and figures help make DC-S come alive for the reader and assist in learning and retaining the concepts presented. Formal endorsements from an international panel of renown interpreter educators and scholars describe this text as &#x201c;aesthetically pleasing,&#x201d; praising its &#x201c;lively, accessible style,&#x201d; its &#x201c;logic and organization,&#x201d; and referring to it as an &#x201c;invaluable resource&#x201d; with international appeal to &#x201c;scholars and teachers.&#x201d; Spoken language interpreters also are proponents of DC-S and will find the material in this text applicable to their education and practice, as well. For more information regarding DC-S, including training opportunities and supervision, visit www.DemandControlSchema.com.</p><p>Robyn K. Dean and Robert Q Pollard, Jr. It was in 1995 that Robyn Dean and Robert Pollard presented their first public lecture on what would eventually blossom into the demand control schema (DC-S). Subsequently, through 22 co-authored publications, nine DC-S related research and training grants, and scores of lectures and workshops, the milestone represented by this textbook has been achieved. Dean and Pollard&#x2019;s distinct yet complimentary talents have been instrumental in driving this work forward and achieving the international acclaim it has garnered, not only for DC-S itself but for recognition that interpreting is a &#x201c;practice profession.&#x201d; Ms. Dean, a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester (UR) School of Medicine, continues her research and teaching activities internationally.

Some people appear authentic and sincere even when the facts discredit them, and many people fall victim to conspiracy theories and economic scams that should be dismissed as obviously ludicrous. This happens because of a near-universal human tendency to operate within a mindset that can be characterized as a &#x201c;truth-default.&#x201d; We uncritically accept most of the messages we receive as &#x201c;honest.&#x201d; We all are perceptually blind to deception. We are hardwired to be duped. The question is, can anything be done to militate against our vulnerability to deception without further eroding the trust in people and social institutions that we so desperately need in civil society?<br><br> Timothy R. Levine&#x2019;s <i>Duped: Truth-Default Theory and the Social Science of Lying and Deception </i>recounts a decades-long program of empirical research that culminates in a new theory of deception&#x2014;truth-default theory. This theory holds that the content of incoming communication is typically and uncritically accepted as true, and most of the time, this is good. Truth-default allows humans to function socially. Further, because most deception is enacted by a few prolific liars, the so called &#x201c;truth-bias&#x201d; is not really a bias after all. Passive belief makes us right most of the time, but the catch is that it also makes us vulnerable to occasional deceit.<br><br> Levine&#x2019;s research on lie detection and truth-bias has produced many provocative new findings over the years. He has uncovered what makes some people more believable than others and has discovered several ways to improve lie-detection accuracy. In <i>Duped</i>, Levine details where these ideas came from, how they were tested, and how the findings combine to produce a coherent new understanding of human deception and deception detection.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Timothy R. Levine</b> is distinguished professor and chair of the department of communication studies at the University of Alabama&#x2013;Birmingham. He has been studying deception for more than twenty-five years and has published his research in more than 140 articles in academic journals.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Tim Levine has given us an elegant and persuasive explanation of one of the oldest puzzles in psychology. Why are human beings so easily deceived? <i>Duped</i> has completely changed my understanding of liars and their lies.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Malcolm Gladwell, author of <i>Outliers: The Story of Success</i> and host of the podcast <i>Revisionist History</i><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Amelia Bedelia Is for the Birds (I Can Read Level 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Learn to read with young Amelia Bedelia!</strong> Amelia Bedelia has been loved by readers for more than fifty years, and it turns out that her childhood is full of silly mix-ups, too!</p><p>When a pair of robins begins building a nest in Amelia Bedelia's swing set, she is torn between wanting to clear it off so that she can continue to slide down her slide, and giving up that fun so she can watch the birds raising their babies.

His classic work,&nbsp;<em>Sermon on the Mount: The Key to Success</em>&nbsp;<em>in Life</em>, is a manual for living harmoniously,&nbsp;providing powerful wisdom that has already influenced such esteemed writers as Wayne Dyer, Esther Hicks, and Louise Hay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emmet Fox shows how to: Understand the true nature of divine wisdom. Tap into the power of prayer. Develop a completely integrated and fully expressed personality. Transform negative attitudes into life-affirming beliefs. Claim our divine right to the full abundance of life. For anyone seeking guidance in their life, for anyone influenced by&nbsp;<em>The Law of Attraction</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Secret</em>, and by the teachings of fellow New Thought leader Eric Butterworth, Fox&#x2019;s words and ideas will resonate deeply.</p></p><p><i>The Sermon on the Mount</i>--now passing its 65th birthday--remains a vital and provocative introduction to the ideas at the heart of Christian Science. At heart it means to be entirely practical, as the "Science" of the name would indicate. Denying any interest in theology (there is no theology in the Bible, Fox argues), the author instead suggests that what Jesus was after was results: "Jesus explains to us what the nature of God is, and what our own nature is; tells us the meaning of life and of death; shows us why we make mistakes; why we yield to temptation; why we become sick, and impoverished, and old; and, most important of all, he tells us how all these evils may be overcome, and how we may bring health, happiness, and true prosperity into our lives."<p> And the Spiritual Key? Fox puts it quite simply: "The Truth turns out to be nothing less than the amazing but undeniable fact that the whole outer world--whether it be the physical body, the common things of life, the winds and the rain, the clouds, the earth itself--is amenable to man's thought, and that he has dominion over it when he knows it." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><p>The Classic Manualfor Harmonious Living</p><p>One of the foremost spiritualteachers of the twentieth century,Emmet Fox offers us strategies for bringinghealth, happiness, and prosperity into ourlives. This enduring spiritual classic revealshow to transform negative attitudes intolife-affirming beliefs, understand the natureof divine wisdom, tap into the power ofprayer, and claim our divine right to allof life's abundance.</p></p><h2>Welcome to Trucktown!

This collection of three fictional stories was inspired by historic battles and real military practice. Each story tells the remarkable adventures of a soldier and his service dog and is rendered with fascinating and beautiful detail, bringing to life the faithful dogs who braved bombs, barrages, and battles to save the lives of countless soldiers. <br> Based on the real-life roles of military dogs that served as Red Cross rescuers, messengers, scouts, search-and-rescue teams, sentries, and mascots, DOGS OF WAR captures both the adventure and the devastation brought on by war, as well as the celebrations of life and friendship between boys and their dogs.</p><p>Sheila Keenan is the author of many nonfiction books, including GREETINGS FROM THE 50 STATES; ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE; O, SAY CAN YOU SEE?; GODS, GODDESSES, AND MONSTERS; and the SCHOLASTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES. She lives in New York City.<br>Nathan Fox is an illustrator and storyteller whose work has appeared in the NEW YORK TIMES, the NEW YORKER, ROLLING STONE, WIRED, and ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, among others. His work has also been published by DC Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Marvel. He lives with his family in New York City.<i><b>School Library Journal</b></i><b> Starred Review<br></b>Keenan has created an exhilarating and suspenseful set of stories about three soldiers and their dogs while also&nbsp;giving a general overview of different wars and touching on some period political and cultural events. Donnie and his dog, Boots, are medics lost deep in the trenches of World War I, trying to find their platoon. Rescuers stationed in Greenland, Cooper and his dog, Loki, are sent to save a downed World War II pilot. The book ends with the compelling story of Lanford, a vet back from Vietnam suffering from flashbacks of his scout dog, Sheba. These relationships feel genuine and are well developed, showing the training process and the reliance each one had with the&nbsp; other in order to stay alive. By the end, readers will feel that these dogs were not just helpers, but true soldiers worthy of honor. Fox&#x2019;s illustrations do a wonderful job of showing the devastating nature of these conflicts without sensationalized violence. The backgrounds are exceptional, showing the extremes of each story&#x2019;s harsh and dangerous environment. A prologue gives more information about each war and a history of solider dogs up to present day. This stunning graphic novel will be a hit with reluctant readers and history lovers.<br><br><i><b>The Bulletin&nbsp;of the Center for Children's Books</b></i><b> Starred Review<br></b>The title may prioritize dogs, but these three historical fiction stories in this graphic novel actually focus more strongly on the men who served with those dogs in three different wars. In &#x201c;Boots,&#x201d; sixteen-year-old Marcellinus McDonald is a doctor&#x2019;s assistant on the Western Front in 1914, and Boots is his beloved &#x201c;mercy dog,&#x201d; who finds the wounded in No Man&#x2019;s Land. &#x201c;Loki&#x201d; is a sled dog in a rescue unit stationed in 1942 Greenland, where his master relies on him in a solo encounter with some reconnoitering Nazis. The final story, &#x201c;Sheba,&#x201d; follows young Henry in 1968 North Carolina as his struggles with his obstreperous beagle pup bring him friendship with a recently returned Vietnam vet haunted by his experience on patrol with his German shepherd, Sheba. Keenan creates vivid voices for her characters, effectively tucking in exposition to convey information about everything from military objectives to daily life details in three very different situations. There&#x2019;s action aplenty, but the rhythms and trajectories vary effectively: &#x201c;Boots&#x201d; is a classic story of the Christmas Truce; &#x201c;Loki&#x201d; is an adventure tale of intelligence and hand-to-hand combat; &#x201c;Sheba,&#x201d; which could stand alone as a book in its own right, is a poignant tale of male bonding between a young fatherless African-American boy and a black soldier overwhelmed by his experiences. Though the chaos of the action scenes can make them difficult to read, the art is atmospheric and effective, blending cinematic heroism, especially in the portraits of the dogs, with often daunting realism. Diehard warmongers, dog fans, and graphic-novel readers will all find something new here, and this will be an easy booktalk to readers reluctant and otherwise.&nbsp;</p><h2>Animal 4.5</h2><p>From the moment Animal&#39;s former lover Red Sonja showed up on his doorstep, he knew trouble wouldn&#39;t be far behind. It wasn&#39;t because the last time he&#39;d seen her, he had been fleeing for his life from a strange island. Nor was it because of the little girl she had in tow, claiming Animal was the father. It was because women like Red Sonja carried trouble around with them like designer purses. He knew getting involved with Sonja again would come at a price, but he had no idea how steep the price would be until it was too late. With his wife gone and his children abducted by a ruthless drug cartel, Animal must lead a suicide mission into the lair of one of the most dangerous assassins in the world, a woman who calls herself Tiger Lily. To go against Tiger Lily and the cartel, Animal would need an army, so the call to arms is put out and the streets readily answer. Leading a handful of loyal souls against seemingly insurmountable odds, Animal races against the clock to save his children and put a stop to Tiger Lily and the cartel&#39;s plans, while trying to stay one step ahead of the two detectives following the trail of bodies.

It was a three-story pink stucco building between Ninety-first Street and Ninety-first Place, just about a mile outside of Watts proper. Twelve units. All occupied for that month. I had just gathered the dirt into a neat pile when I heard Mofass drive up in his new '53 Pontiac. I knew it was him because there was something wrong with the transmission, you could hear its high singing from a block away. I heard his door slam and his loud hello to Mrs. Trajillo, who always sat at her window on the first floor?best burglar alarm you could have.<br><br>I knew that Mofass collected the late rent on the second Thursday of the month; that's why I chose that particular Thursday to clean. I had money and the law on my mind, and Mofass was the only man I knew who might be able to set me straight.<br><br>I wasn't the only one to hear the Pontiac.<br><br>The doorknob to Apartment J jiggled and the door came open showing Poinsettia Jackson's sallow, sorry face.<br><br>She was a tall young woman with yellowish eyes and thick, slack lips.<br><br>"Hi, Easy," she drawled in the saddest high voice. She was a natural tenor but she screwed her voice higher to make me feel sorry for her.<br><br>All I felt was sick. The open door let the stink of incense from her prayer altar flow out across my newly swept hall.<br><br>"Poinsettia," I replied, then I turned quickly away as if my sweeping might escape if I didn't move to catch it.<br><br>"I heard Mofass down there," she said. "You hear him?"<br><br>"I just been workin'. That's all."<br><br>She opened the door and draped her emaciated body against the jamb. The nightcoat was stretched taut across her chest. Even though Poinsettia had gotten terribly thin after her accident, she still had a large frame.<br><br>"I gotta talk to him, Easy. You know I been so sick that I cain't even walk down there. Maybe you could go on down an tell'im that I need t'talk."<br><br>"He collectin' the late rent, Poinsettia. If you ain't paid him all you gotta do is wait. He'll be up here soon enough to talk to you."<br><br>"But I don't have it," she cried.<br><br>"You better tell'im that," I said. It didn't mean anything, I just wanted to say the last word and get down to work on the second floor.<br><br>"Could you talk to him, Easy? Couldn't you tell'im how sick I am?"<br><br>"He know how sick you are, Poinsettia. All he gotta do is look at you and he could tell that. But you know Mofass is business. He wants that rent."<br><br>"But maybe you could tell him about me, Easy."<br><br>She smiled at me. It was the kind of smile that once made men want to go out of their way. But Poinsettia's fine skin had slackened and she smelled like an old woman, even with the incense and perfume. Instead of wanting to help her I just wanted to get away.<br><br>"Sure, I'll ask 'im. But you know he don't work for me," I lied. "It's the other way around."<br><br>"Go on down there now, Easy," she begged. "Go ask 'im to let me slide a month or two."<br><br>She hadn't paid a penny in four months already, but it wouldn't have been smart for me to say that to her.<br><br>"Lemme talk to 'im later, Poinsettia. He'd just get mad if I stopped him on the steps."<br><br>"Go to 'im now, Easy. I hear him coming." She pulled at her robe with frantic fingers.<br><br>I could hear him too. Three loud knocks on a door, probably unit B, and then, in his deep voice, "Rent!"<br><br>"I'll go on down," I said to Poinsettia's ashen toes.<br><br>I pushed the dirt into my long-handled dustpan and made my way down to the second floor, sweeping off each stair as I went. I had just started gathering the dirt into a pile when Mofass came struggling up the stairs.<br><br>He'd lean forward to grab the railing, then pull himself up the stairs, hugging and wheezing like an old bulldog.<br><br>Mofass looked like an old bulldog too; a bulldog in a three-piece brown suit. He was fat but powerfully built, with low sloping shoulders and thick arms. He always had a cigar in his mouth or between his broad fingers. His color was dark brown but bright, as if a powerful lamp shone just below his skin.<br><br>"Mr. Rawlins," Mofass said to me. He made sure to be respectful when talking to anyone. Even if I actually had been his cleanup man he would have called me mister.<br><br>"Mofass," I said back. That was the only name he let anyone call him. "I need to discuss something with you after I finish here. Maybe we could go somewhere and have some lunch."<br><br>"Suits me," he said, clamping down on his cigar.<br><br>He grabbed the rail to the third floor and began to pull himself up there.<br><br>I went back to my work and worry.<br><br>Each floor of the Magnolia Street building had a short hallway with two apartments on either side. At the far end was a large window that let in the morning sun. That's why I fell in love with the place. The morning sun shone in, warming up the cold concrete floors and brightening the first part of your day. Sometimes I'd go there even when there was no work to be done. Mrs. Trajillo would stop me at the front door and ask, "Something wrong with the plumbing, Mr. Rawlins?" And I'd tell her that Mofass had me checking on the roof or that Lily Brown had seen a mouse a few weeks back and I was checking the traps. It was always best if I said something about a rodent or bugs, because Mrs. Trajillo was a sensitive woman who couldn't stand the idea of anything crawling down around the level of her feet.<br><br>Then I'd go upstairs and stand in the window, looking down into the street. Sometimes I'd stand there for an hour and more, watching the cars and clouds making their ways. There was a peaceful feeling about the streets of Los Angeles in those days.<br><br>Everybody on the second floor had a job, so I could sit around the halls all morning and nobody would bother me.<br><br>But that was all over. Just one letter from the government had ended my good life.<br><br>Everybody thought I was the handyman and that Mofass collected the rent for some white lady downtown. I owned three buildings, the Magnolia Street place being the largest, and a small house on 116th Street. All I had to do was the maintenance work, which I liked because whenever you hired somebody to work for you they always took too long and charged too much. And when I wasn't doing that I could do my little private job.<br><br>On top of real estate I was in the business of favors. I'd do something for somebody, like find a missing husband or figure out who's been breaking into so-and-so's store, and then maybe they could do me a good turn one day. It was a real country way of doing business. At that time almost everybody in my neighborhood had come from the country around southern Texas and Louisiana.<br><br>People would come to me if they had serious trouble but couldn't go to the police. Maybe somebody stole their money or their illegally registered car. Maybe they worried about their daughter's company or a wayward son. I settled disputes that would have otherwise come to bloodshed. I had a reputation for fairness and the strength of my convictions among the poor. Ninety-nine out of a hundred black folk were poor back then, so my reputation went quite a way.<br><br>I wasn't on anybody's payroll, and even though the rent was never steady, I still had enough money for food and liquor.<br><br>"What you mean, not today?" Mofass's deep voice echoed down the stairs. After that came the strained cries of Poinsettia.<br><br>"Cryin' ain't gonna pay the rent, Miss Jackson."<br><br>"I ain't got it! You know I ain't got it an' you know why too!"<br><br>"I know you ain't got it, that's why I'm here. This ain't my reg'lar collectin' day, ya know. I come to tell you folks that don't pay up, the gravy train is busted."<br><br>"I can't pay ya, Mofass. I ain't got it and I'm sick."<br><br>"Lissen here." His voice dropped a little. "This is my job. My money comes from the rent I collect fo' Mrs. Davenport. You see, I bring her a stack'a money from her buildin's and then she counts it. And when she finishes countin' she takes out my little piece. Now when I bring her more money I get more, and when I bring in less..."<br><br>Mofass didn't finish, because Poinsettia started crying.<br><br>"Let me loose!" Mofass shouted. "Let go, girl!"<br><br>"But you promised!" Poinsettia cried. "You promised!"<br><br>"I ain't promised nuthin'! Let go now!"<br><br>A few moments later I could hear him coming down the stairs.<br><br>"I be back on Saturday, and if you ain't got the money then you better be gone!" he shouted.<br><br>"You can go to hell!" Poinsettia cried in a strong tenor voice. "You shitty-assed bastard! I'ma call Willie on yo' black ass. He know all about you! Willie chew yo' shitty ass off!"<br><br>Mofass came down the stair holding on to the rail. He was walking slowly amid the curses and screams. I wondered if he even heard them.<br><br>"bastard!!" shouted Poinsettia.<br><br>"Are you ready to leave, Mr. Rawlins?" he asked me.<br><br>"I got the first floor yet."<br><br>"Mothahfuckin' bastard!"<br><br>"I'll be out in the car then. Take your time." Mofass waved his cigar in the air, leaving a peaceful trail of blue smoke.<br><br>When the front door on the first floor closed, Poinsettia stopped shouting and slammed her own door. Everything was quiet again. The sun was still warming the concrete floor and everything was as beautiful as always.<br><br>But it wasn't going to last long. Soon Poinsettia would be in the street and I'd have the morning sun in my jail cell.<br><br>Copyright � 2002 by Walter Mosley</p><h2>How to Knit Socks That Fit: Techniques for Toe-Up and Cuff-Down Styles.

In addition to the prejudice Hoy faced, he could not hear the umpires' calls. One day he asked the umpire to use hand signals: strike, ball, out.

He lives in New Zealand.PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;This picture book biography demonstrates how an extraordinary deaf player from the early days of baseball made a lasting contribution to the game. The ambitions of William Hoy (1862&#x2013;1961) were clear from the start. The boy thought of little other than baseball and practiced tirelessly in hopes of playing on a team. Achieving his goal brought challenges that he didn't expect, but giving up was not an option. Hoy realized that better communication was needed and knew just the way to do it. While he was not the only person to introduce hand signals to the game, he did popularize their use among players and fans. The book is well told and charmingly illustrated in a semirealistic style that conveys Hoy's emotions. Those who enjoyed Audrey Vernick's Brothers at Bat: The True Story of an Amazing All-Brother Baseball Team (Clarion, 2012) will want to read this engaging biography.

Old TestamentNo Bio</p><h2>When All You&#39;ve Ever Wanted Isn&#39;t Enough: The Search for a Life That Matters</h2><p>With the same compassion and wisdom that powered his phenomenal bestseller <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People,</i> Harold Kushner addresses a need that is universal and timeless -- the wish for a meaningful life. <br> Why is it that, after attaining many of our goals, we are left with a sense that something vital is missing? In his deeply inspiring bestseller, Rabbi Kushner shows us how to live as human beings are meant to. He guides us to a heightened sense of joy, purpose, and meaning, and helps us to redirect our energies toward goals that will bring us lasting happiness and true fulfillment.</p><p><b>Harold Kushner</b> has written many bestselling books that&nbsp;have helped millions of people find in faith a source of help for coping with life's problems.Kushner's new book is likely to match his When Bad Things Happen to Good People as a bestseller. In the rabbi's sympathetic and eminently readable guide, discontented people can find reasons to banish doubts on whether living is worthwhile. The Book of Ecclesiastes is the main source of reassurance here, for the spiritually bankrupt. Citing the short entry in the Old Testament as "the most dangerous in the Bible," the author argues that a fear of uselessness is humanity's ancient enemy. Ecclesiastes poured out his complaints that all his wealth and wisdom and achievements were nothing: he must die and be forgotten like an animal. Why does God withhold the power to enjoy the gifts that are the scribe's by the grace of God? Exploring the despair voiced in these pages, Kushner emphasizes the lesson that the unknown writer finally learned more than 1000 years agoevery person matters. Readers will benefit from Kushner's advice on making their lives matter to themselves and others.

All this, in addition to raising her three biological sons and two adopted daughters. What would motivate someone to give herself over to constant, largely uncompensated chaos? For Harrison, the answer is easy.<br><br><b>Another Place at the Table</b> is the story of life at our social services' front lines, centered on three children who, when they come together in Harrison's home, nearly destroy it. It is the frank first-person story of a woman whose compassionate best intentions for a child are sometimes all that stand between violence and redemption.</p><p><b>A Conversation with Kathy Harrison<br> about herself, her book, her marriage, stereotypes, the system, cocktail parties, and what she'd do if she had a weekend to herself</b> <p> <b>When you were little and people asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up, did you ever imagine it would be "foster mom"?</b><br> No. I didn't even want children. I was going to be rich and famous and live in New York City. I figured I would be a writer. </p><p> <b>Why a writer?</b><br> I've always written, from the time I was little. I wrote stories, fables, children's stuff. I kept journals. When I started doing foster care, I used journals with the children. </p><p> <b>How do you use journals with the children?</b><br> When kids come to me and they've been in twenty-seven different homes, they don't remember much of their past. They think they were hatched at age nine or something. What I often do is buy them a little binder notebook and say, "Tell me the first thing you remember. Who's the first person you remember living with?" If that person is not the birth mother, I will talk to the child's caseworker and see if I can learn the child's exact history. Then I will tell the child-say her name is Anna-"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Anna. When she was born, she had a mother, whose name was Elizabeth. But Elizabeth couldn't take care of her well enough, so Anna went to live with her aunt Sally." And so on. When I'm done with the story, Anna has a picture of her past so she can write it down in her journal herself. It's a timeline. <br><br> I also use journals with teenagers. Imagine being fifteen and walking into some stranger's house, especially if you don't happen to speak English. I say to teenagers, "Tell me your story." Then, if they do, I say, "That's so interesting-this is like the best work of fiction, but it's real. Why don't you write it down?" The alternative is that they'll put on headphones and veg out for hours. <br><br> Another thing I might say to kids is, "Wow, this is how long your life has been so far, but this is how long you have left." I want to give them a sense of wide-open futures and the opportunity to make good choices from this point forward. </p><p> <b>What about you? Do you still keep a journal?</b><br> Yes. Writing helps me process things. For example, when a child first comes to me, I often write down the child's story and from that compile a list of strengths and needs. In the course of writing, I get a clearer understanding of children and their families. It puts things in a context that I can understand. I have a sense of, "Oh, now I get it. I see how this happened and who these people are in the world." It also helps me cope with some of the horror of a particular story. It's cheaper and more accessible than a therapist. <br><br> I'm not good at keeping a specific journal, though. I'll write something in one notebook, and then in another-fragments here and there. I'll write in margins of books, on napkins, backs of envelopes. I'm always saying, "Does anyone have a paper bag? I need to write something down." <br><br> My husband bought me one of those handheld tape recorders. But it's not the same. For me, writing has to be longhand. It has something to do with how I sit to write, how the words go on the paper. Writing isn't just the product, it's also the process. There's a physical side to it. </p><p> <b>Did you write this book longhand, or on a computer?</b><br> The first five drafts were handwritten. The initial part of the writing process for me always has to be handwritten. After those drafts, though, I typed the text into a computer. I still don't know how to cut and paste. I have to ask the kids. <br><br> When did you go from saying, "I want to be a writer in New York City," to, "I want to be a foster mom"? <br><br> I never said to myself, "I want to be a foster mom." That was never the plan. <br><br> My husband and I got married and had our first son. We moved to a rural environment-a town with seven hundred people, a farm in the middle of nowhere. Then we had another couple of kids. I liked having kids. I liked being a mother-baking bread, giving baths, the physical stuff. <br><br> When it was time for me to think about gainful employment, I took some classes and taught preschool. I loved being in the classroom, having children around. <br><br> Then I met my first little girl who needed a home. She's starting college next week. <br><br> There was never an epiphany moment when I said, "This is what I want to do." I slid into it. During that slide, I had moments when I said to myself, "Holy smoke! This is really interesting!" <br><br> What is it about being a foster parent that you find interesting? <br><br> I'm not a cocktail party girl. But when we do go to cocktail parties, the other guests are talking about their investments or their computers, and are probably thinking about me, "She's fifty years old and she's still home?" And what I'm thinking is, "You have no idea how interesting my life is!" <br><br> We all like to glimpse into other people's lives. I think I'm nosy by nature. It's interesting for me to see how other families work and survive. <br><br> Some families live lives about which you think: "How do they stand the trauma? I couldn't stand the trauma." But some of these families actually thrive on it. <br><br> Kids themselves are amazingly perceptive and courageous and smart. They slay me when they tell me some of their stories-fifteen moves, not knowing where they're going to be tomorrow. And yet they get up in the morning and put one foot in front of the other. How interesting is that? How lucky am I? I have the opportunity to hold their hands. <br><br> I think I've become an adrenaline junkie as far as what I do. This is real drama, complete with mysteries and heroes and villains and plot twists. I'm energized by the unexpected. </p><p> <b>Why did you write this book?</b><br> I'm a writer. A Boston Globe reporter wanted to write a book about what I do. But my husband said to me, "You write it. This is the book you want to write." <br><br> Foster parents are among the most misunderstood people in the world. There seems to be a mental picture of foster parents-we're either selfless saints, or we're leeches of society who take in children and spend government money on Cadillacs while we feed the kids macaroni and cheese, and lock them in the closet. <br><br> The truth is, I'm not a saint. I can get impatient. I don't always make the right choices. Sometimes I just want to go into my bedroom and lock the door. But I'm also not cruel and awful. In this book, I wanted to offer a more authentic and realistic public image of people who choose to do foster care. <br><br> I also wanted people to read the book and say, "I can do this." And I wanted to tell my kids' stories. There's this image of kids in foster care, that they're all hideous delinquents. And instead, so many of them are remarkable. They have sweet streaks. Even the worst kids can have sweet streaks. <br><br> I had a horrible child-difficult as can be, retarded, very aggressive and violent, sneaky, sometimes really mean. A hard kid. I thought, "What have I gotten myself into?" But when she came into the house, she looked around and said, "My God, this is like living in a party!" Just like that, as soon as her attitude changed, my attitude changed. There are moments that are quite sweet. Underneath it all, the kids are just kids. <br><br> How do you keep your equilibrium with the other people in these kids' lives-the birth parents, the caseworkers, the social workers, the attorneys? When you meet birth parents who were or are awful to the kids, are you tempted to lecture or yell at them? <br><br> I'm the sort of person who wants everyone to do what I want, yesterday. I want everyone to do what my kids want. I'm that way with attorneys and social workers and caseworkers. But not with birth parents. </p><p> <b>Why not?</b><br> These birth parents were six years old themselves once upon a time, and nobody helped them. If someone had, none of this would be happening now. <br><br> I can have long conversations in my head in which I tell a birth parent what to do. But judgment doesn't help. What I see in the birth parents is an enormous amount of pain and anger and fear. <br><br> Still, there are kinds of abuse that would blow your mind. The sexual abuse of children is incomprehensible to me, and after all these years, I'm still floored when mothers choose abusive mates over the welfare of their children. I can wrap my brain around the idea of a parent's losing it and shaking a baby or hitting a child harder than intended, but I struggle to come up with any empathy in cases of planned, systematic abuse or lack of remorse. There is neglect that comes from poverty or a parent's limitations, but I've seen parents who smoke while trying to justify not feeding their babies. </p><p> <b>What was your childhood like? Do your own experiences as a child help you now with your foster children?</b><br> Yes, there's no question. As for my childhood-there was a fair amount of good stuff with a fair amount of awful stuff. The family structure was there. I have two brothers and a sister, who are very successful now-good lives, solid marriages, nice kids. We're very tight. We all talk to at least one of the others every day. <br><br> When we were kids, we always had one another. We also always had somebody in the background-some adult-who was willing to prop us up. There was always somebody to tell us, "You are so bright." My mother felt that we were smart and capable. I realize that I might be that person for my kids. </p><p> <b>What role does your husband play in your kids' lives?</b><br> Bruce feels very strongly that he's often the only normal guy that my little girls and my adolescent girls ever see. He's so good with them. He says, "I'm the only book they're going to read on what a guy should be like." <br><br> Last night, he was washing the dishes after working a nine-hour day. I had started to do them, but he said, "No, I want you to take a swim. I can do this in ten minutes." Isn't that a good message for the kids? <br><br> Bruce feels it's important for the kids to see a man who can be patient and kind and nurturing. Even if he and I get annoyed with the kids, we rarely lose our tempers. When we find ourselves not working well with a child, we usually ask to have the child moved rather than risk not meeting the child's needs. We are both pretty good at realizing that children use behaviors to express their feelings, so we don't take things personally. <br><br> If the kids are getting to us, Bruce and I will give ourselves a time-out. I figure that God invented The Lion King to give parents an hour of peace and quiet. </p><p> <b>It can be hard enough balancing marriage with conventional parenthood. What is it like balancing marriage with foster parenthood?</b><br> That's another message we give to our kids-that Bruce and I need to have our time together. We guard that time. We're not opposed to telling the kids that they need to find something to do at certain times. <br><br> Bruce and I find time alone. We're hedonistic about it. We have coffee together on the deck every morning. And every night, we have coffee, tea, or a drink and sit on the deck. Most nights, if the weather is good, we're in the pool at ten, eleven o'clock. We call it our "sacred spot." The kids know they're not allowed there unless their hair's on fire. This gives Bruce and me enough energy to face the next challenge. <br><br> He and I have a standing Thursday-night date. We don't do anything spectacular. Sometimes we'll get a bottle of wine and rent a movie or play cards. We might just watch television or look at the stars. What we do isn't important, but the time alone together is. We don't even answer the phone. It's wonderful. </p><p> <b>If you had a weekend to yourself-no kids, no husband, no obligations-what would you do?</b><br> I would get homesick. My home is my favorite place to be. I'm on the go so much with the kids that I cherish an uninterrupted hour sitting on my deck, watching the birds. If I had a weekend of uninterrupted time, I would use it to enjoy the things I already cherish-heaven for me is a cup of tea and enjoying a murder mystery in front of the fire. I love to cook, and I'm an avid reader. </p><p> <b>How many foster children do you have in your house right now?</b><br> I have four, and I'm getting two new ones this afternoon. I usually have six. Two girls went home yesterday-two adolescent girls, very different from each other. One of them we had for a year and a half. The other one, we had for a week. The first one we sent home with a whole new set of skills. She promises that she'll keep her nose clean, that she's going to do the right thing. She's an A student, beautiful, smart. We spent the last three months talking about choices, how her life depends on making good ones. I told her, "If you make good choices, your life can be whatever you choose it to be." It was different with the other girl, the one I had for only a week. I had the same conversation with her, but delayed and condensed. I told her, Your life may seem like it's over, but it doesn't have to be this way." She said, "All I want is for my life to be normal. I want a normal life where I get up, someone makes me breakfast, someone's there, and there's no violence. That's what I want my dad to give me." Her whole life to this point has been nothing but violence. <br><br> I told her, "I don't think that's going to happen. But there's a choice you can make here. You can say, 'I'm going to stay away from violent men. I'm going to make my best efforts in school and always do my homework.'" <br><br> If kids did their homework, a lot of them wouldn't have so many problems. I'm very strict about this. Life is not fun around my house if you don't do your homework! </p><p> <b>What is the hardest part about being a foster mom?</b><br> I usually know exactly what a child needs after a while-better than the child's therapist or social worker. But it's very frustrating for me when I can't obtain those things. It's difficult to have to say, time and time again, "This is what this kid needs, so why can't she have it? Really, what would it cost?" </p><p> <b>Is funding for social services getting better or worse?</b><br> Things are getting worse. Caseworker numbers are way down. It used to be that you could always get a caseworker, but now you can't. <br><br> Since 9/11, funding for everything has been cut. There used to be a program called Parenting Partners. When I had a child in care who was ready to go home, I would be available to the child's mother as a support person. I could do things that social workers rarely have time to do. I could work on parenting skills and household management and provide some respite child-care. In effect, I could be a parent figure to the parent. At ten dollars an hour, I was a bargain. Unfortunately, the program was defunded, and that safety net disappeared. </p><p> <b>Is lack of funding the only problem at the institutional level? Are poor planning or bad decision making also problems?</b><br> Yes. For example, we know that adolescents don't do well in foster homes. There's an intimacy involved that's hard for them. What they really need are small, structured group homes-four to six kids, rotating house parents, one set of mom an...</p>Kathy Harrison has been a foster parent to nearly one hundred children.

William Still, himself a son of slaves, was named its secretary and executive director. Deeply moved by the stories of the fugitive slaves he helped conduct northward, Still took his committee record-keeping to a higher level. He wrote down, in eloquent narrative form, every detail of their stirring, often heartbreaking histories.<br>Second only to the great Harriet Tubman in the number of freedom-seeking "passengers" he conducted through the Underground Railroad, Still let the words of former slaves speak for themselves. In his journals, he painstakingly reproduced vivid accounts he heard from their very lips. And he added excerpts from letters, newspapers, and legal documents to the already arresting biographical sketches, creating unforgettable portraits of the slaves' deadly struggles, brutal hardships, and narrow escapes.<br>When the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished, William Still published his journals as <i>The Underground Railroad</i>. It is considered the most complete firsthand account ever written of the men, women, and children who rode the legendary "Railroad" to freedom.

The recipes will make cooking with traditional Indian flavors and spices approachable for the US market. Aarti's stories will dissolve the "foreign-ness" of Indian flavors and make seemingly complicated technique and flavor accessible. She will take the intimidation factor out of cooking Indian food by simplifying traditional recipes, offering many specific how-to's, and also tips on using traditionally Indian spices in new ways, in everyday dishes. And there is a streak of Middle Eastern in some of these recipes given her youth in Dubai. <br><br> <br> Recipes include: Cornflake &amp; Kaya French Toast, Real Deal Hummus, Masala Kale Chips, Mum's Everyday Dal, Sambar (Vegetable &amp; Lentil Stew), Pregnancy Potatoes (Crispy masala potato wedges), Indian Street Corn, Saag Paneer, Quinoa Tabbouleh, Chickpea &amp; Artichoke Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Bombay Sloppy Joes, Spicy Sticky Lamb Chops, Mango Pulled Pork Sandwiches, Masala Shrimp &amp; Grits, Homemade "Magic Shell" with Garam Masala &amp; Sea Salt, Strawberry-Rose Petal Shortcakes. Finally, the narratives that open each chapter are wonderfully evocative, telling the story of a woman who was an outsider experiencing many cultures and cuisines: an Indian in Dubai, going to a British school; an international student attending Northwestern University to become an American journalist; and a wife of a Los Angeles man who leaves her job at CNN and becomes a Food Network Star. She finds that food always saves her and encourages us all to find the warmth in cooking.</p><p><b>Aarti Sequeira </b>is host of <i>Taste in Translation </i>on the Cooking Channel.

Her cat, Angus, is trying to eat the poodle next door. And her best friend thinks she looks like an alien - just because she accidentally shaved off her eyebrows. Ergghhhlack. Still, add a little boy-stalking, teacher-baiting, and full-frontal snogging with a Sex God, and Georgia's year just might turn out to be the most fabbitty fab fab ever!</p></p><p>She has a precocious 3-year-old sister who tends to leave wet nappies at the foot of her bed, an insane cat who is prone to leg-shredding "Call of the Wild" episodes, and embarrassing parents who make her want to escape to Stonehenge and dance with the Druids. No wonder 14-year-old Georgia Nicolson laments, "Honestly, what is the point?" A Bridget Jones for the younger set, Georgia records the momentous events of her life--and they are all momentous--in her diary, which serves as a truly hilarious account of what it means to be a modern girl on the cusp of womanhood. No matter that her particular story takes place in England, the account of her experiences rings true across the ocean (and besides, "Georgia's Glossary" swiftly eradicates any language barriers). <p> The author, Louise Rennison, is a British comedy writer and it shows. Whether Georgia is dealing with wearing a bra ("OK, it's a bit on the loose side and does ride up round my neck if I run for the bus"), pondering kissing and how to know which way to turn your head ("You don't want to be bobbing around like pigeons for hours"), or managing the results of an overzealous eyebrow-plucking episode ("Obviously, now I have to stay in forever"), she always cracks us up. Georgia struggles with the myriad issues facing teen girls--boys, of course being at the forefront--but she does it with such humor and honesty it almost seems like a good time. This refreshingly funny book is ripe for a sequel, which readers will await in droves.

Rather, they recruited an elite group of young women who, with only pencil, paper, and mathematical prowess, transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible. <br><br>For the first time, <i>Rise of the Rocket Girls</i> tells the stories of these women--known as "human computers"--who broke the boundaries of both gender and science. Based on extensive research and interviews with all the living members of the team, <i>Rise of the Rocket Girls</i> offers a unique perspective on the role of women in science: both where we've been, and the far reaches of space to which we're heading. <br><b>"</b><b><b>If <em>Hidden Figures</em> has you itching to learn more about the women who worked in the space program, pick up Nathalia Holt's lively, immensely readable history, <i>Rise of the Rocket Girls</i>." --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b></b><b></b><i></i><br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2016:</strong> Women's history buffs rejoice!

Or as the author himself described it front of a national television audience, "I wanted to write the Great American Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Novel." In actuality, it is a collection of hard-luck stories, off-and-on-color jokes, script scraps, found letters, free rhymes, drug flashbacks, and other missing scenes, all exploring the world of show business with fingers prying in the cracks and feet set lightly in the black humors of the real world. With chapters about books found in Monty Clift's basement and&nbsp;Tupac Shakur's 10 favorite novels, and a set of 11 suicide notes with room included for the reader's signature, the book is a one-of-a-kind post-postmodern examination of the dangers of public life from a unique voice in independent culture, one that might make William S. Burroughs sigh and turn the page at least.</p></p><p>The original Ritalin kid, Harmony Korine burst on the scene with "Kids, a film so gritty and unsettling in its depiction of teen life that it was slapped with an NC-17 rating and banned in some theaters across the country. In some ways, the media frenzy over the rating overshadowed the harrowing portrait of teenagers destroying their lives and the then twenty-one-year-old screenwriter who created them. "Whether you see the movie as a masterpiece or as sensationalism," wrote Lynn Hirshberg, "the movie is relentless and brilliant and extremely disturbing. It's powerful-both steel-eyed and sexy; horrifying and captivating." <p><br>Now, in this first book of fictional set pieces, Korine captures the fragmented moments of a life observed through the demented lens of media, TV, and teen obsession. Korine reinvents the novel in this highly experimental montage of scenes that seem both real and surreal at the same time. With a filmmaker's eye and a prankster's glee, this bizarre collection of jokes, half-remembered scenes, dialogue fragments, movie ideas, and suicide notes is an episodic, epigrammatic lovesong to the world of images. Korine is the voice of his media-savvy generation and "A Crack-Up at the Race Riots is the satiric lovechild of his dark imagination.</p><b>Harmony Korine</b> is the director of the films <i>Gummo, Julien Donkey-Boy, Mister Lonely, Spring Breakers, </i>and <i>Trash Humpers,</i> as well as music videos for artists such as Cat Power, Sonic Youth, and Will Oldham.

Expounding on the theme, &#34;What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul&#34;. St. Alphonsus dwells repeatedly on the Four Last Things: Death, Judgment, Heaven and Hell. Relentlessly, he brings the reader to considering his own eternal destiny. No one can read these sermons without being profoundly moved. Impr. 437 pgs, PB</p><p>St. Alphonsus Liguori was born in 1696 to Neapolitan nobility at Marianella, Italy. He became a recognizable lawyer after going through law school at the age of sixteen, but later decided to leave law in favor of giving his salvation more attention. Alphonsus joined the Oratory of St. Philip Neri as a seminarian and was ordained in 1726, when he was thirty. The homilies he gave had the special ability of converting those who had fallen away from the faith. He also founded the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, and authored such works as <i>The Glories of Mary</i>, <i>The True Spouse of Jesus Christ</i>, <i>Attaining Salvation</i>, <i>The Blessed Virgin Mary</i>, <i>Preparation for Death Abridged</i>, <i>What Will Hell Be Like?</i>, <i>The Twelve Steps to Holiness and Salvation</i>, and <i>The Way of the Cross</i>.<br><br> After being a bishop for over a decade, St. Alphonsus Liguori died on the first of August, 1787. He was canonized by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839, and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1871. His feast is celebrated on August 1.</p><h2>The Naked Socialist</h2><p>The NAKED SOCIALIST provides an astonishing, new look at the greatest power of darkness and force yet born into the earth. It is the real story of socialism. In this hard hitting single volume, author Paul B. Skousen strips away the fakery, the false hopes, the hollow dreams, and meaningless promises that socialists have foisted on countless millions for thousands of years. He explains what socialism is, where it came from, how it works, and why it always destroys its host nation. This easy-to-read overview exposes socialism&#x2019;s track record from more than 6,000 years ago, and follows it right up until today, giving proof of its predictable failure to create, innovate, and protect. Skousen fulfills an urgent need to answer such questions as, Is Barack Obama a socialist? How much of the U.S. Constitution has been replaced with socialism? What is socialism, and why is it bad? Why did the Founding Fathers specifically make socialism illegal? How did socialism destroy Rome, Jamestown, and Plymouth? Are these same patterns of demise at work today? Which U.S. presidents socialized America? How is socialism hurting nations around the globe? What are the best examples of socialism in action today? What are the Seven Pillars of Socialism? How may people learn to recognize socialism in their midst, or if they&#x2019;re thinking like a socialist? What are the 46 goals of socialism? What will it take to eradicate socialism once and for all?</p><p>Paul B.

While this collaboration between Julie Andrews and her daughter, Emma Hamilton, does not stand out as anything particularly different, it does have enough sparkle to keep young readers interested. Geraldine leads a rather ordinary life, and each page highlights a part of her mundane day. However, in the grand tradition of other literary, bedazzled mini-divas, Geraldine's imagination and love for the color pink brighten the daily grind of being a scab-kneed little girl. Readers will enjoy Geraldine's princess attitude and the vibrant fantasy brought to life through Davenier's ink and colored pencil illustrations. However, for girly girl stories with a bit more attitude, stick with reigning princesses Eloise, Fancy Nancy, and Olivia.&#x2014;<i>Sarah Townsend, Norfolk Public Library, VA</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

In Lessons near-death expert Kenneth Ring extracts the pure gold of the NDE and with a beautiful balance of sound research and human insight reveals the practical wisdom held within these experiences. As Stanley Krippner states, &#34;In this remarkable book, Ring presents evidence that merely learning about the near-death experience has similar positive effects to those reported by people who actually have had near-death experiences. Kenneth Ring is one of the few authors whose gifts include the capacity to transform their readers&#39; lives.&#34;</p><p>Kenneth Ring, Ph.D. is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Connecticut and Co-Founder and Past President of the International Association for Near-Death Studies. Regarded by many as the &#34;Dean of NDE Researchers,&#34; he is the Founding Editor of the Journal of Near-Death Studies and the author of several books including his best-selling book Life At Death, Heading toward Omega, and The Omega Project. He lives in Kentfield, California.The capstone of Kenneth Ring's career, this book is the distillation of all that death can teach the living. Ring's loving voice turns harrowing and resplendent near-death stories never published before into a practical guide that motivates through its sheer heart-gripping beauty. No reader will ever be able to think of life in the same way again after reading this book. -- Jenny Wade, Ph.D., author of Changes of Mind: A Holononic Theory of the Evolution of Consciousness<br><br>This is unquestionably the most important book on the subject of near-death experience since Moody's Life After Life. -- Ian Wilson, author of The After Death Experience<br><br>Lessons from the Light opens the last door each of us will face in our lifetime. With clarity, wit, and crisp prose, it brings us to the cutting edge of what promises to be the most important discovery ever made in psychobiology-what truly happens after death. -- Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D., National Book Award-winning author of Taking the Quantum Leap and The Spiritual Universe<br><br>Lessons from the Light is the culmination of Kenneth Ring's rich and extensive career as the foremost researcher of the NDE. One of the very best books on the subject to date, it is a must read for anyone interested in life's possibilities. -- Sukie Miller, Ph.D., author of After Death: Mapping the Journey and director of The Institute for the Study of the Afterdeath<br>A beautiful melding of research and compassionate, intuitive analysis. An inspirational book filled with both spiritual insight and practical information to help us realize our own personal power. -- Caroline Myss, Ph.D. author of Anatomy of the Spirit<br><br>A magnificent achievement! Ring's new book is the best book on NDEs! For while he is indeed one of the leading scholars in the field, he now brings in his heart and shows those of us who haven't had an NDE how to use the inspiration of NDEs to change our lives. -- Charles T. Tart, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Psychology, University of California, Davis; author of Altered States of Consciousness and Living the Mindful Life<br><br>A major contribution that offers a wealth of fresh case materials together with balanced and insightful commentary. -- Raymond A. Moody, Ph.D., author of Life After Life and Reunions<br><br>Arguably, the best book yet on the near-death experience. -- Michael Grosso, Ph.D., author of The Millenium Myth and Soulmaking: Uncommon Paths to Self-Understanding<br><br>Lessons from the Light is the best and most complete book on the near-death experience I've ever read, and I believe it will help you overcome your fears of dying. -- Seymour Boorstein, M.D., Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and author of Clinical Studies in Transpersonal Psychotherapy</p><h2>Vision: Color and Composition for Film</h2><p>Featuring hundreds of carefully hand-crafted illustrations as well as significant tuition on how to best compose and use images to create the most powerful frames, this book is potentially Hans P.

That interest is dwarfed only by parents' desire to develop a deep, growing faith in their own kids. Yet both national leaders with broad spheres of influence as well as local, grassroots practitioners are waking up to the reality that <b>almost half of their graduating seniors will drift from God and the church after high school</b>. As leaders and as parents, we're not satisfied with that. We suspect you're not either.<br>In response to this problem, the Fuller Youth Institute (FYI) conducted a national longitudinal study following over 500 high school seniors during their first three years in college. The goals of this research were to understand the dynamics of youth group graduates' transition to college and to identify the relationships and best practices in youth ministries, churches, and families that can help set students on a trajectory of lifelong faith and service.&nbsp;<br>In <i>Sticky Faith</i>, the team at FYI presents youth workers with both a philosophical framework and practical programming ideas that develop long-term faith in teenagers.

In &#39;Your 15th Club&#39;, Rotella gives golfers a plan to follow to always have their mind perform at its peak.</p><p>Dr. Bob Rotella is a consultant to the PGA of America, the PGA Tour, and the LPGA Tour. He is the author of several bestselling golf books including GOLF IS NOT A GAME OF PERFECT.<p><b>1.</b></p><p><b>Confidence -- <br>Plain and Unvarnished</b></p><p>Padraig Harrington helped crystallize my reason for writing this book. Padraig is a very thoughtful, analytical man. He's been a client and a friend for ten years, but I wouldn't call myself his mental coach or his sports psychologist. Padraig and I have conversations. My role usually amounts to listening to the things he's figured out and nodding my head. I learn as much from Padraig as he learns from me.</p><p>Not long ago, Padraig mentioned that he recommends the book I wrote in 1994, <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i>, to the people he plays with, including fellow pros. I was intrigued, and not just because word of mouth is the best advertising. I know that Padraig is a friendly, generous fellow, but I also know that he's a competitor down to the bone. I know he thought <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i> had helped him, so I was curious as to why he'd recommend the book to players who were trying to take away what he has -- the top ranking among European players.</p><p>"I'm not worried if someone reads it," he said when I asked him about it. "That's fine. It's an easy read. They'll enjoy it. They'll gain from it. But they won't get the real benefit unless they live it -- and that's the hard part. So I can tell my competitors to go and read <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i> and I know I'm not giving anything up unless they actually do the work."</p><p>Padraig's statement meshed with thoughts I'd been having for a while. As a sports psychologist, I go to my clients as often as they come to me, especially after I've been working with them for some time. Since many of them are tournament golfers, I see them at tournament venues -- generally on the putting green or the practice range. Players who have worked with me often need only a quick conversation to clear up a specific question and prepare their minds for a competitive round.</p><p>Frequently, as I move down the range or around the green, I chat with players who aren't clients, at least not in the traditional sense. They may not have worked with me personally, but they've read <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i> or another of my books on golf and the mind. They're generally complimentary. Increasingly, though, in recent years, I've heard something like this:</p><p>"Doc, I read <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i> eight years ago, and it really helped me. I was able to play my best golf in the clutch, coming down the stretch. In fact, I won a couple of times right after I read it. But lately, it doesn't seem to be working as well. I think you ought to write another book."</p><p>This is that book. But it's not going to be another iteration of <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i> or any of its sequels.</p><p>I'm afraid I may have been inadvertently misleading in those books. It's not that they contain any misinformation. They don't. When I wrote <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i>, I conveyed the truth about the mental side of golf under pressure, truth I'd learned working in several sports and field-tested over fifteen years with professional golfers. Those years of field-testing have now stretched close to thirty, and I'm more convinced than ever about what works for golfers. You've got to follow your dreams. You will become what you think about yourself. You've got to train your swing, then trust it. You've got to accept the mistakes that inevitably happen on the golf course. You've got to manage your temper as well as the course. You've got to fall in love with the short game, the part of golf that most heavily impacts scoring. Above all, you must be confident.</p><p>But in my previous books, as Padraig and other pros have helped me realize, I failed to stress one very important aspect of the mental game. I may have left the impression that mastering the mental game was like riding a bicycle, something you could learn and then always be able to do.</p><p>It's not. The fact is that having the sort of mind that stands up to clutch situations and wins golf tournaments is much more like having a fit body. Yes, you have to work to reach a desired level of fitness. But, once you're there, you have to work to keep it. Your body will slide back into softness and weakness if you don't continue to work out. Your mental game, too, will become soft and weak if you don't continue to monitor it and work on it. That's the work Padraig was talking about.</p><p>This, I think, explains the statements I've heard from players who say that an earlier book helped them for a while but doesn't seem to work as well anymore. It's because those books didn't make it clear enough that for golfers, having a strong mind in the clutch is part of a process. While the books were fresh in their memories, these players were unconsciously engaged in a process that strengthened their minds. They came through under pressure and played the sort of golf they had always sensed they could play. But golf is a little bit like the ocean's waves. Just as the waves will work relentlessly to erode the dunes at the top of a beach, golf will work relentlessly to erode a player's confidence. Just as beach towns have to work constantly and vigilantly to strengthen and protect their dunes, golfers must work to maintain their confidence and the strength of their minds.</p><p>Maybe, like the players I sometimes meet on Tour, you read <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i> a dozen years ago and find that your mind seems to work less effectively now than it did right after you read it. If so, it's not because that book is any less valid. It's because I failed to emphasize that you need to commit yourself to a constant process of strengthening your mind. It's as if you hired a personal trainer a dozen years ago and worked with him until you could bench-press 200 pounds and run a mile in six minutes. But the trainer left town without giving you a workout plan to sustain that level of performance. For that omission, I apologize.</p><p>The book you're holding will correct that deficiency. Like my previous books, it will have a few stories and anecdotes about players. I hope it will be, in places, entertaining to read. But I will do a bit less storytelling in this book, because I want to emphasize the process of developing and maintaining a strong mental game. I want you to be confronted on every page, not with stories about other golfers, but with things you need to know and do to strengthen your mind so that you can play your best golf in the clutch. I want reading this book to be like sitting with me in my basement in Virginia, where I counsel players, or talking with me on the practice range at a Tour event. I don't often tell stories in those settings. I tell players what I think they need to hear. I give it to them plain and unvarnished.</p><p>Sometimes it can be hard for golfers to hear this. People want quick results. I've yet to see someone try to sell a diet program that will give you the body you want -- a year from now. The automobile companies don't advise you to save your money and budget carefully if you want a top-of-the-line luxury model. They all know people want instant gratification. I'm not promising immediate results in this book. I'm talking about a process that will steadily strengthen your mind and keep it strong for as long as you stay on it. But that doesn't mean you'll win tomorrow if you read the book tonight.</p><p>There's another reason why the things I am going to tell you in this book may not appeal to everyone. For some reason, in our culture, it's a lot easier for many people to admit they're working on their golf swings than it is to admit they're working on their thinking. People will go for years to golf professionals for lessons on their mechanics. They'll spend weeks on drills that are designed to improve their swings and groove good movements. They'll chat with their friends on the practice range, sometimes a bit too much, about the things they're doing to make their swings better. Or they might go see a fitness trainer and get a new stretching routine. They'll drop to the ground and twist like a yoga master at the first sign someone's interested in seeing a demonstration of what they're doing. And I'm glad they will. I'm the first to say that success in golf is a product of both body and mind. If you want to be the best golfer you can be, you've got to master certain physical fundamentals.</p><p>But if players are eager to talk about the changes they're making in their mechanics, why do they shy away from talking about a mental overhaul? On a logical level, this doesn't make sense to me. Why should someone show you, without embarrassment, a drill that requires him to hit balls standing on one foot like a flamingo and yet be reluctant to discuss the fifteen minutes he spends at night visualizing success? I don't know. If I told people that they could win a major championship by spending an hour a night walking across a bed of hot coals, many of them would immediately start taking off their shoes and socks. But the thought of spending that same hour working on their psyche doesn't appeal to them. Maybe it's because a physical or mechanical flaw seems to be a little farther from the core of a person's identity. A thinking flaw strikes closer to who we are.</p><p>This, I believe, is why a lot of golfers hit a wall when they reach the stage where their mechanics are no longer the primary obstacle. They've put in lots of hours learning to strike the ball well. Whether their goal is winning major championships or getting to a single-digit handicap, they have the physical skills to do it. But they start to lose traction. Often, they regress. They can't admit to themselves that it's their thinking that's holding them back. They don't commit themselves to a program to strengthen their minds. They fail to change.</p><p>So the first thing I'm asking you to do as you read this book is to be honest with yourself. Is your present way of thinking consistent with the level of golf you'd like to play? Does it help you in the clutch, or does it handicap you? Does it enable you to find out how good you could be?</p><p>And do you dare to change it?Copyright � 2008 by Robert J.

More and more, churches and individual Christians are looking for ways to practice economic discipleship, but it's hard to make progress when we are blind to our own entanglement in our culture's idolatrous economic beliefs and practices. <br><br><i>Practicing the King's Economy </i>cuts through much confusion and invites Christians to take their place within the biblical story of the "King Jesus Economy." Through eye-opening true stories of economic discipleship in action, and with a solid exploration of six key biblical themes, the authors offer practical ways for God's people to earn, invest, spend, compensate, save, share, and give in ways that embody God's love and provision for the world.<br><br>Foreword by Christopher J. H. Wright.</p><p>"Here is economic wisdom for humans with habits and desires, immersed in patterns and practices. Here is a model of economic discipleship that doesn't just tell you what to think but how to practically live in an economy of the kingdom.

This revolutionary theory of acting&#x2014;developed by Stanislavski&nbsp;and continued by Strasberg&#x2014;has been a major influence on the art of acting in our time. During his last decade, Strasberg devoted himself to a work that would explain once and for all what The Method was and how it worked, as well as telling the story of its development and of the people involved with it.

In 1969, he established the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. He died in 1982.Strasberg's posthumous memoir traces the creation of his famous "Method," the most influential actor-training technique ever developed. At the beginning of his career, Strasberg embarked on a search for the sources of the actor's creativity and a means of consistently attaining emotional truth on stage. His solution, inspired by the work of Stanislavsky's Moscow Arts Theatre, was transmitted to a generation of actors at the Actor's Studio of New York. Strasberg's reminiscences are an exploration of the creative process that will reward all who are interested in the nature of inspiration. Essential for theater collections.

First, as the nation immersed itself in the global conflict later known as World War I, some 118,000 Minnesotans served in the war effort, both at home and "over there"&#x2013;and citizens on the home front were subjected to loyalty tests and new depths of government surveillance. While more than 1,400 Minnesotans were killed on the battlefields, an additional 2,300 soldiers were struck down by another destructive force working its way across the globe in 1918: the influenza pandemic, which left more than 10,000 dead in Minnesota alone. Then, in mid-October, fires raged across 1,500 square miles in seven counties of northeastern Minnesota, leaving thousands homeless and hundreds dead. <br><br>In <em>Minnesota, 1918</em>, journalist and author Curt Brown explores this monumental year through individual and community stories from all over the state, from residents of small towns up north obliterated by the fire, to government officials in metropolitan centers faced with the spread of a deadly and highly contagious disease, to soldiers returning home to all this from the "war to end all wars."</p><p><strong>Curt Brown</strong> spent more than 30 years as a reporter at Minnesota newspapers in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Fergus Falls. He writes a popular Minnesota history column every Sunday for the Minneapolis <em>Star Tribune</em>; the stories were collected in the e-book publication, <em>Frozen in History: Amazing Tales from Minnesota's Past</em>. Brown was named Minnesota Journalist of the Year in 2013 for his serial narrative on the U.S.-Dakota War. He is also the author of the book <em>So Terrible a Storm: A Tale of Fury on Lake Superior</em>, which chronicles a massive storm in 1905. Brown lives near Durango, Colorado, with his wife, Adele.&#x201c;Curt Brown&#x2019;s <em>Minnesota, 1918</em> is an evocative and vivid portrayal of the almost unimaginable series of catastrophes that struck the land of 10,000 lakes in the last year of World War I. A moving, intensely human story.&#x201d;<br><br><strong>James Carl Nelson</strong>, author of <em>The Remains of Company D: A Story of the Great War</em><br>&#x201c;With great skill and sensitivity, Curt Brown weaves together the epic stories of the effect on Minnesota of the Great War, the Spanish flu epidemic, and the Cloquet&#x2013;Moose Lake fires. The year 1918 was a painful one for Minnesotans, bringing suffering for many and death for an astounding number. Although these tragic events took place one hundred years ago, Brown brings them to life with vivid human stories.&#x201d;<br><br><strong>Francis Carroll</strong>, author of <em>The Fires of Autumn: The Cloquet&#x2013;Moose Lake Disaster of 1918</em><br>&#x201c;Mr. Brown has done an excellent job of covering fire, flu epidemic, and world war and ties them all together to show the impact across the state. Because my mother-in-law&#x2019;s family were fire survivors, I am very familiar with the impact the fire had on her family and the surrounding area. In addition, my father-in-law was injured in Argonne, France, during the war. This book gives me a new perspective into that year.&#x201d;<br><br><strong>Natalie Frohrip</strong>, executive director of the Moose Lake Area Historical Society</p><h2>The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach</h2><p>The question of the historicity of Jesus' resurrection has been repeatedly probed, investigated and debated. And the results have varied widely. Perhaps some now regard this issue as the burned-over district of New Testament scholarship. Could there be any new and promising approach to this problem? Yes, answers Michael Licona. And he convincingly points us to a significant deficiency in approaching this question: our historiographical orientation and practice. So he opens this study with an extensive consideration of historiography and the particular problem of investigating claims of miracles. This alone is a valuable contribution. But then Licona carefully applies his principles and methods to the question of Jesus' resurrection. In addition to determining and working from the most reliable sources and bedrock historical evidence, Licona critically weighs other prominent hypotheses. His own argument is a challenging and closely argued case for the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ. Any future approaches to dealing with this "prize puzzle" of New Testament study will need to be routed through <em>The Resurrection of Jesus.</em></p><p><strong>Michael R. Licona</strong> (Ph.D., University of Pretoria) is Research Professor of New Testament at Southern Evangelical Seminary and on staff at the North American Mission Board."Licona has tackled his subject energetically, with near-obsessive thoroughness....I am not aware of any scholar who has previously offered such a thorough and fair-minded account of the historiographical prolegomena to the resurrection question." <b>Richard B. Hays,</b> Duke Divinity School</p><h2>Think and Grow Rich - Original Edition</h2><p>Over 25 years ago, Napoleon Hill, then a young special investigator for a nationally known business magazine, was sent to interview Andrew Carnegie. During that interview Carnegie slyly dropped a hint of certain master power he used; a magic law of the human mind - a little known psychological principle - which was amazing in its power. Carnegie suggested to Hill that upon that principle he could build the philosophy of all personal success - whether it be measured in terms of Money, Power, Position, Prestige, Influence, or Accumulation of Wealth. That part of the interview never went into Hill&#39;s magazine. But it did launch the young author upon over 20 years of research. And today we open to YOU the discovery and methods of using the revolutionary force which Carnegie quietly hinted at. The thrilling methods of using it are now taught in eight textbooks known as the LAW OF SUCCESS. In the trail of the LAW OF SUCCESS lessons come accomplishments, not mere entertainment and time-killing diversion. There come larger businesses, bigger bank accounts, fatter pay envelopes; small enterprises given new life and power to grow; low-pay employees shown how to gain advancement by leaps and bounds. Think and Grow Rich is Napoleon Hill&#39;s newest book, based upon his famous LAW OF SUCCESS philosophy. His work and writings have been praised by great leaders in finance, education, politics, and government.</p><p>This original version of THINK AND GROW RICH from our publishing boutique, Black Swan Publishing, Atlanta Georgia is the best version to capture the full message and philosophy of this timeless book.

And there&#39;s never been a villain quite like Gulo the Savage: a vicious beast-eating wolverine who descends upon the Abbey in search of a relic called the Walking Stone. Readers will cheer at the return of the Long Patrol, the antics of a renegade vole thief, and the emergence of a new champion to wield the sword of Martin. As fans of Brian Jacques and Redwall know, the adventures just keep getting bigger and bigger.</p><p><p><b>Brian Jacques</b>&nbsp;was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland.&nbsp;A well-known radio personality in his native Liverpool--as well as an actor, stand-up comic, and playwright--Brian was the host of "Jakestown" on BBC Radio Merseyside. Ever the performer, Jacques applied his acting and entertainment background to his lively presentations to legions of young fans at schools across the United States and England.</p><p>His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of: Daniel Defoe, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Thomas Malory, Robert Michael Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Grahame. He attended St. John's School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John's, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The teacher could not, and would not, believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar". He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.</p><p>Some teachers at St. John's proved to be good role models.&nbsp;This interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith. It was also at St. John's that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life.</p><p>After Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Penguin mourns the passing of celebrated children&#x2019;s book author Brian Jacques</b></p>Grade 5-9&#x2013;Jacques once again delivers a heroic tale of friendship, valor, and a battle between good and evil. Gulo the Savage and his army of vermin invade Mossflower Country to murder his brother and capture the coveted Walking Stone. Rakkety Tam MacBurl, a highland warrior, and his companion Wild Doogy Plumm, join forces with the hares of the Long Patrol Regiment and the occupants and friends of Redwall Abbey to defeat the villains. Numerous battles occur across Mossflower Country and eventually end at the doorstep of Redwall Abbey. This fast-paced adventure will keep readers on their toes until the final battle. Elliot's ink sketches appear at the head of each chapter, giving readers a glimpse of what is to come. Some characters' accents may pose a slight challenge for those not familiar with the previous books.

In today&#x2019;s reform-minded, information-based society, practitioners must be able to frame problems correctly and then make effective decisions to ameliorate them. As leaders, district and school-level administrators are expected to focus on what should be done to improve schools; as managers, they are expected to focus on how to do things successfully. The cases in this book are designed to make students think about common problems of practice by encouraging them to bridge theory and practice. Each case provides an active form of learning, allowing students to demonstrate their ability to apply knowledge to common problem situations. </p></p><p><p>What is the best way to immerse prospective administrators in the reality of practice? Perhaps no other tool better gives educational leadership students a better grasp of their future profession than open-ended case studies.

Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity, and unexpected revelations?<br><br>A big novel about a small town, <i>The Casual Vacancy </i>is J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults. It is the work of a storyteller like no other.</p><p><strong>J.K. Rowling</strong> is the author of the bestselling Harry Potter series of seven books, published between 1997 and 2007, which have sold over 450 million copies worldwide, are distributed in more than 200 territories<strong>,</strong> have been translated into 73 languages, and have been turned into eight blockbuster films.<br><br>As well as an Order of the British Empire for services to children's literature, J.K. Rowling is the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees, including the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord, France's L�gion d'honneur, and the Hans Christian Andersen Award, and she has been a commencement speaker at Harvard University. She supports a wide range of causes and is the founder of Lumos, which works to transform the lives of disadvantaged children.On the face of it, Rowling's first adult book is very different from the Harry Potter books that made her rich and famous. It's resolutely unmagical: the closest thing to wizardry is the ability to hack into the amateurish Pagford Parish Council Web site. Instead of a battle for worldwide domination, there's a fight over a suddenly empty seat on that Council, the vacancy of the title. Yet despite the lack of invisibility cloaks and pensieves, Pagford isn't so different from Harry's world. There's a massive divide between the haves and those pesky have-nots&#x2014;the residents of the Fields, the council flat that some want to push off onto Yarvil, the county council nearby. In tiny Pagford, and at its school, which caters to have and have-nots alike, everyone is connected: teenager Krystal Weedon, the sole functioning member of her working-class family, hooks up with the middle-class son of her guidance counselor; the social worker watching over Krystal's troubled mother dates the law partner of the son of the dead Councilor's fiercest Council rival, who also happens to be the best friend of Councilor Barry Fairbrother; Krystal's great-grandmother's doctor was Fairbrother's closest ally; the daughters of the doctor and the social worker work together, along with the best friend of Krystal's hookup; and so on. When Fairbrother&#x2014;born in Fields but now a middle-class Pagforder and one of the few people who can deal with the obstreperous Krystal&#x2014;dies suddenly, the fight gets uglier. Rowling is relentlessly competent: all these people and their hatreds and hopes are established and mixed together. Secrets are revealed, relationships twist and break, and the book rolls toward its awful, logical climax with aplomb. As in the Harry Potter books, children make mistakes and join together with a common cause, accompanied here by adults, some malicious, some trying yet failing. Minus the magic, though, good and evil are depressingly human, and while the characters are all well drawn and believable, they aren't much fun. Agent: The Blair Partnership.

Lewis observed how modern education was changing our conception of what it means to be human. By cutting off students from the transcendent values of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty, modern schools ceased cultivating virtue in students and instead communicated a mechanistic vision of the world that viewed students as products to be engineered. Lewis believed that in seeking to control nature, modern conditioners would also seek to control humans and remake them according to the preference of the conditioners, since any appeal to Truth, Goodness, or Beauty had been rejected. Lewis argued that we must recover these transcendent values in order to prevent the dehumanizing tendency in modern education and renew the cultivation of virtue in our students.<br>With Awakening Wonder, Steve Turley demonstrates that it is precisely such a recovery that is at the heart of the current classical education renewal. Once again, Truth, Goodness, and Beauty are celebrated as those objective values that are essential for cultivating students as flourishing human beings. In these pages you will discover the history and development of these transcendent values and how they redeem our senses and sanctify our imaginations. Teachers will also learn how to incorporate these values into their teaching to awaken awe and wonder in both themselves and their students.</p><p>Steve Turley (PhD, Durham University) is a theologian, social theorist, classical Christian educator, and prize-winning classical guitarist. A faculty member at Tall Oaks Classical School in New Castle, Delaware, he teaches theology, Greek, and rhetoric. He is also Professor of Fine Arts at Eastern University. His research and writings have appeared in such journals as Christianity and Literature, Calvin Theological Journal, First Things, Touchstone, and The Chesterton Review.As we continue in our day with the task of rebuilding classical Christian education, one of the things we absolutely must do is reexamine the thought of some of the giants produced in times past by an earlier iteration of that same kind of education. And that is exactly what Grant Horner has done in this fine treatment of Milton.

In this seventh volume of L&#x2019;Amour&#x2019;s collected short stories, you&#x2019;ll find some of his most popular characters, heroes who have become a part of our cultural legacy, as well as the ordinary men and women whose adventures are chronicled with an immediacy no reader can resist&#x2013;or ever forget.<br><br> In Louis L&#x2019; Amour&#x2019;s frontier stories, the American West is the crucible in which character is tested, reputations are won or lost, and life always hangs in the balance. Struggling to survive against the elements, hostile Indians, or outlaws who prey upon the honest and hardworking, the men and women in these tales each come face-to-face with what they&#x2019;re made of&#x2013;often in moments that explode with the violence of an avalanche or the speed of a drawn gun. Here L&#x2019;Amour demonstrates the unerring touch for detail and keen insight into human nature that lend these stories the power to thrill, surprise, and entertain readers of every generation.<br><br> A man driven by his faith in the woman he loves survives war, Indian massacre, and near starvation only to find his homecoming delayed by one last battle&#x2013;under his own roof. To stop a range war, a ranch foreman stands up to his boss, his men, and conspirators who seem to have both right and might on their side. And in a town where fourteen men have already died under suspicious circumstances, a new sheriff by the name of Utah Blaine patiently sets a trap for a frontier serial killer.<br><br> Here are stories of honest thieves and crooked lawmen, of dream chasers and treasure hunters, of men and women hoping for a second chance and others down to their last. This rich and varied cast embodies not only the spirit of the West but the timeless struggle of the best and worst in us all, on a stage as big as the frontier itself. Full of suspense, mystery, adventure, this remarkable collection has everything that&#x2019;s earned Louis L&#x2019;Amour his well-deserved reputation as America&#x2019;s favorite storyteller.</p><p>With more than 120 titles still in print, Louis L'Amour is recognized the world over as one of the most prolific and popular American authors in history.

What does it mean to be a teacher today, when students are more diverse in language, culture, race, and social class than ever before? What does it take to thrive, when the demands of teaching have never been greater? Sonia Nieto found and interviewed 22 teachers of varying backgrounds and school settings who help answer the question of what effective, culturally responsive teaching looks like in the real world. Their stories of success, failure, frustration and hope will resonate with everyone who has struggled to meet the needs of diverse students in our current sociopolitical context. </p> <p> Nieto explores the common themes that arose throughout the interviews, of teaching with a social justice perspective, the moral dimensions of teaching, advocating for students, and challenging the status quo. She raises a persuasive argument that teaching is an ethical endeavor, that we must honor students' identities and believe in their futures, and that ultimately teaching is an act of love.

Another discerning work on the challenges teachers face when they confront the status quo, and the joy they find in working with young people who are often viewed as "the other" by the mainstream of society. Finding Joy in Teaching Students of Diverse Backgrounds presents a grim view of the mindless uniformity imposed upon our schools by standardized curricula. But the voices of the teachers leave us with a sense of hope that, if we cannot change the world, each of us can at least change a piece of it for children we respect and love." --Jonathan Kozol<br><br>"Sonia Nieto reminds us in this beautifully written book that powerful instruction is happening all around us and that we need to look to our classrooms and our thriving teachers for guidance and direction.

By the time of his death at the age of 90 in 1965, many thought him to be the greatest man in the world.</p><p>There have been over a thousand previous biographies of Churchill. Andrew Roberts now draws on over forty new sources, including the private diaries of King George VI, used in no previous Churchill biography to depict him more intimately and persuasively than any of its predecessors. The book in no way conceals Churchill's faults and it allows the reader to appreciate his virtues and character in full: his titanic capacity for work (and drink), his ability see the big picture, his willingness to take risks and insistence on being where the action was, his good humour even in the most desperate circumstances, the breadth and strength of his friendships and his extraordinary propensity to burst into tears at unexpected moments. Above all, it shows us the wellsprings of his personality - his lifelong desire to please his father (even long after his father's death) but aristocratic disdain for the opinions of almost everyone else, his love of the British Empire, his sense of history and its connection to the present.</p><p>During the Second World War, Churchill summoned a particular scientist to see him several times for technical advice. 'It was the same whenever we met', wrote the young man, 'I had a feeling of being recharged by a source of living power.' Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt's emissary, wrote 'Wherever he was, there was a battlefront.' Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, Churchill's essential partner in strategy and most severe critic in private, wrote in his diary, 'I thank God I was given such an opportunity of working alongside such a man, and of having my eyes opened to the fact that occasionally such supermen exist on this earth.'</p></p><p></p><h2>Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: A Therapist&#39;s Guide, 2nd Edition (The Practical Therapist)</h2><p>Updated resource for practicing therapists from the father of rational therapy. Modern cognitive-behavioral therapy has its roots in the rational approach created by Ellis in the 1950s. Now known as Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Ellis&#x2019;s systematic integrative approach has grown and matured into a powerful mainstream psychotherapy. Hundreds of thousands of patients have benefited from the active interventions of therapists using REBT. Includes a thorough description of REBT theory and procedures, case examples, exercises. Major themes include: The Theory of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy; The Practice of REBT; The Main Cognitive Techniques of REBT; The Main Emotive and Experiential Techniques of REBT; The Main Behavioral Techniques of REBT; The Integration of REBT with Other Psychotherapies; Summary and Conclusions.</p><p>Books in THE PRACTICAL THERAPIST SERIES are designed to answer the troubling &#34;what-do-I-do-now-and-how-do-I-do-it?&#34; questions often confronted in the practice of psychotherapy. Written in plain language, technically innovative, theoretically integrative, filled with case examples, THE PRACTICAL THERAPIST SERIES brings the wisdom and experience of expert mentors to the desk of every therapist.Our primary goal with RATIONAL EMOTIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: A THERAPIST'S GUIDE is to present you, the mental health professional, with a comprehensive look at Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) in an easy-to-read format. <p>The first portion of the book focuses on answering the questions: How, when, and where did REBT originate? We discuss the philosophically based origins of the theory as well as the core reasons that people become disturbed and stay disturbable. </p><p>We have then devoted several chapters to the actual hands-on practice of REBT. We begin with a discussion of the assessment phase of therapy and then describe the variety of specific cognitive, emotive, and behavioral interventions commonly used in this approach. We have also included numerous case examples in order to facilitate your learning process. </p><p>Finally, we have included a chapter on integrating REBT with a range of other theoretical frameworks. Whether you are a newcomer to the field or a seasoned professional, we hope that you enjoy this book and use it as a reference guide in the future.</p></p><h2>Qualitative Research: A Multi-Methods Approach to Projects for Doctor of Ministry Theses</h2><p>The Association of Theological Schools states, The purpose of the Doctor of Ministry degree is to enhance the practice of ministry for persons who hold the MDiv degree and have engaged in ministerial leadership. The goals an institution adopts for the DMin should include an advanced understanding of the nature and purposes of ministry, enhanced competencies in pastoral analysis and ministerial skills, the integration of these dimensions into the theologically reflective practice of ministry, new knowledge about the practice of ministry, and continued growth in spiritual maturity . . . The program shall include the design and completion of a written doctoral-level project that addresses both the nature and the practice of ministry. The project should be of sufficient quality that it contributes to the practice of ministry as judged by professional standards and has the potential for application in other contexts of ministry. Doctor of Ministry projects are a type of participatory action research that introduces an intervention in order to provide ministerial leadership for the transformation of the organization. The intent of Qualitative Research: A Multi-Methods Approach for Doctor of Ministry Projects is to provide the fundamentals of qualitative research so that significant projects and theses emerge.</p><p>Tim Sensing (DMin, PhD) is the Director of Academic Services and Professor of Homiletics at the Graduate School of Theology located on the campus of Abilene Christian University. Tim has taught research methodologies for the Doctor of Ministry program since 1999."Finally! A much-needed resource for Doctor of Ministry programs, this comprehensive text offers a detailed account of the components and purpose of Doctor of Ministry projects . . . His attention to forming mature theological thinkers and critically reflexive researcher-practitioners has the power to enhance the quality and credibility of Doctor of Ministry research projects. Sensing's clarity of thought, purpose, and writing style make this text an excellent resource for both students and faculty." <br>--Lorraine Ste-Marie Assistant Professor on the Faculty of Human Sciences Saint Paul University, Ottawa, Ontario <br><br>"In this volume Dr. Sensing clearly and thoughtfully lays out the process for developing and writing a Doctor of Ministry project thesis. The book focuses primarily on various qualitative research methodologies describing them and giving specific examples of their use. The multi-methods approach he takes allows for both the flexibility and the rigor necessary to produce a quality thesis. Sensing is committed to projects that are grounded in solid theological foundations and implemented in local ministry contexts. This is a must read book for DMin students and advisers." <br>--Dave Bland Professor of Homiletics Harding University School of Theology<br><br>"Tim Sensing has written a major textbook for every seminary's Doctor of Ministry program. Appreciating the strengths and limitations of these programs, Sensing offers a guide and sourcebook for students in designing and writing their project theses. Equally important is his approach to the degree and project in which the student is a practical theologian engaging theology as a communal, formative, critical, and public activity. The church desperately needs quality doctoral work producing rigorous research that contributes to the practice of ministry. Those who share this goal have a valuable new resource." <br>--Lovett H.

At age twenty-four, Hornbacher was diagnosed with Type I rapid-cycle bipolar, the most severe form of bipolar disorder.<br><br>In Madness, in her trademark wry and utterly self-revealing voice, Hornbacher tells her new story. Through scenes of astonishing visceral and emotional power, she takes us inside her own desperate attempts to counteract violently careening mood swings by self-starvation, substance abuse, numbing sex, and self-mutilation. How Hornbacher fights her way up from a madness that all but destroys her, and what it is like to live in a difficult and sometimes beautiful life and marriage -- where bipolar always beckons -- is at the center of this brave and heart-stopping memoir.<br><br>Madness delivers the revelation that Hornbacher is not alone: millions of people in America today are struggling with a variety of disorders that may disguise their bipolar disease. And Hornbacher's fiercely self-aware portrait of her own bipolar as early as age four will powerfully change, too, the current debate on whether bipolar in children actually exists.<br><br>Ten years after Kay Redfield Jamison's An Unquiet Mind, this storm of a memoir will revolutionize our understanding of bipolar disorder.</p><p>"Hornbacher is a virtuoso writer." - <i>New York Times</i><i></i>&nbsp;When Marya Hornbacher published&nbsp;a nationally bestselling memoir of her battle with anorexia and bulimia she had no idea that there was a piece of shattering knowledge that wouold finally make sense of the chaos of her life.&nbsp;Her struggles with&nbsp;mental illness, and&nbsp;the story she would have to tell about them, were far from over.&nbsp;At twenty-four,&nbsp;Hornbacher was diagnosed with Type I rapid-cycle bipolar disorder, the most severe form.

Like Hornbacher, many of us suffer from these never knowing that they are related to&nbsp;bipolar, that there is a larger cause for our particular pain. Now, in this brave, heart-stopping, beautifully written memoir Marya Hornbacher offers a challenge to the perception of bipolar in America.&nbsp;<i>Madness</i> is an incredible&nbsp;portrait&nbsp;of a difficult, sometimes beautiful life.&nbsp;"With the same intimately revelatory and shocking emotional power that marked <i>[Wasted</i>]<i>,</i> Hornbacher guides us through her labyrinth of psychological demons."&nbsp; --<i>Elle</i><p></p><p></p>"Hooks readers from the start ....

What unfolds is an unparalleled road map to the place where we "love as the cosmos loves: One loving itself as an other, yet remembering itself as One."</p></p><p><b>David Deida</b><br>Acknowledged as one of the most insightful and provocative teachers of our time, bestselling author&nbsp;<b>David Deida</b>&nbsp;continues to revolutionize the way that men and women grow spiritually and sexually.

Engulfing most of present-day Germany, the war claimed at least ten million lives. The lengthy conflict was particularly hard on the general population, as thousands of undisciplined mercenaries serving Sweden, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and various German principalities, robbed, murdered, and pillaged communities; disease spread out of control and starvation became commonplace. In <i>The Warwolf</i>, Hermann L�ns's acclaimed historical novel, the tragedy and horrors of war in general, and these times in particular are revealed. <i>The Warwolf</i>, based on the author's careful research, traces the life of Harm Wulf, a land-owning peasant farmer of the northern German heath who realizes after witnessing the murder of neighbours and family at the hands of marauding troops that he has a choice between compromising his morals or succumbing to inevitable torture and death. Despite his desire for peace, Wulf decides to band with his fellow farmers and live like "wolves," fiercely protecting their isolated communities from all intruders. L�ns's brilliant portrayal of the two sides faced by any person in a moral crisis&#x2014;in Harm Wulf's case, whether to kill or be killed&#x2014;continues to resonate. Originally published in 1910 and still in print in Germany, <i>The Warwolf</i> is available for first time in English.</p></p><p>Hermann Lons (1866-1914), a novelist and poet noted for his keen observations of the natural world, was killed early in World War I.

Abandoned as a child by the person he needed the most, he swears he will never allow himself to love again. Ali Daniels denies love as well. Carrying a terrible secret, she lives life to the fullest, taking risks and refusing relationships. When Cody and Ali meet, their first instincts are to hide behind their emotional walls, seemingly doomed to repeat the patterns they have established of roost of their lives. But their attraction is too strong, and soon they&#39;re doomed in another way, for neither can avoid falling in love, regardless of the consequences. Only after three years--a thousand tomorrows later--do they realize at what cost their relationship comes. In the end, they must decide if love is worth the ultimate price.</p><p>Karen Kingsbury is a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of over 60 works of fiction and nonfiction with nearly 25 million copies in print. Widely considered America's favorite inspirational novelist, she is best known for drawing unforgettable characters and stories which evoke a range of emotions. Karen reaches over 100,000 women annually through national speaking appearances. She and her husband, Don, currently reside in Nashville, TN.Kingsbury, a CBA bestselling author, delivers her signature mix of melodrama, formula and genuine emotional punch in this novel about two young rodeo stars and their experiences with Down syndrome and cystic fibrosis. The young leads inhabit Christian romance fiction clich�s: Cody Gunner is the ruggedly handsome outdoorsman with a painful past (his backstory, as it happens, is identical to that of the male lead in Susan May Warren's <i>Happily Ever After</i>) and Ali Daniels is the daintily beautiful yet doggedly determined young cowgirl who wins his heart. Both characters are driven to succeed by a need to overcome hidden pain. Cody has suffered from besetting anger at both of his parents since the day his father left the family because he was unable to handle Cody's brother's Down syndrome. Ali, on the other hand, secretly has cystic fibrosis, and she rides in horse races despite the dust, hay and allergens associated with her sport, which will shorten her already brief life expectancy. When these two predictably fall in love, they provide each other with some measure of healing before the novel reaches its telegraphed conclusion. Despite the plot's limitations, Kingsbury fans will undoubtedly be pleased by more of the inspirational fiction for which this author has become beloved. <i>(Apr. 13)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The result is a brilliant, bizarre, and surreal cosmos - the product of the rational thinking of a creator god and his astral assistants, and of purely mechanistic causes based on the behaviour of the four elements. At times dazzlingly clear, at times intriguingly opaque, this was state-of-the-art science in the middle of the fourth century BC. The world is presented as a battlefield of forces that are unified only by the will of God, who had to do the best he could with recalcitrant building materials. <br> The unfinished companion piece, <em>Critias</em>, is the foundational text for the story of Atlantis.

I told you to come out of that room, Ava. I was knocking on the door, and all I heard was your nasty ass moaning.&#x201d;&#x201d;Whatever, Jada!&#x201d; Ava smoothed her hair out of her face, and popped her gum.Jada and Ava knew they were in trouble. They were supposed to be home by the time the streetlights came on. But it had been dark for a while now, and they knew they were in for it. At sixteen and fourteen years old, respectively, boys were their favorite pastime, and they had snuck off to meet a couple of them.&#x201d;Whatever my ass. I told you to stop letting these li&#x2019;l niggas touch on you and hump you and shit.&#x201d; Jada looked at her sister with disapproval all over her face.&#x201d;Jada, stop fuckin&#x2019; preaching all the time. I only let Derek do all that. And you ain&#x2019;t no saint. Don&#x2019;t sit there and act like you wasn&#x2019;t in the living room with Marlon being just as nasty. So--&#x201d;&#x201d;So, nothing! I knew when it was time to go home, though. We should have been home a long time ago, but your nasty ass didn&#x2019;t want to leave. And you never listen to me when I tell you that we gotta go. Whenever we go somewhere together, and you don&#x2019;t want to leave, I can&#x2019;t leave you behind. You&#x2019;re my sister. Anything can happen out here. And now &#x2018;cause of you, we&#x2019;re late. You know this muthafucka J.D.&#x2019;s gonna be beefing all night now.&#x201d;They walked through the streets of Brooklyn, silenced by worry. Neither of them wanted to face the fury that awaited them at home. They were pretty little ghetto superstars, mulatto girls with glowing complexions and encompassing eyes. Their mother was a blend of French and black, and their father was of Jamaican descent. They had a look that made them stand out from the rest, yet they still had a grit about them that was undeniably hood. The sisters were quite different in personality. Jada was bold, almost wild and adventurous. Everybody in the neighborhood--even the grown folks--knew Jada by name. She was always on the scene. Always with the latest slang and the loudest mouth. Jada&#x2019;s soft brown complexion, shoulder-length dark hair, and striking bone structure made her quite stunning.Ava, on the other hand, was beautiful, but she was timid and delicate and tended to blend into a crowd. Not that she was innocent. Ava was quieter than Jada, but she was just as much a Brooklyn girl as her sister. Ava was boy crazy, and would often intrigue Jada with her stories of passionate make-out sessions with guys. Ava hid this side of her well. So while Jada was usually in the center of the crowd, with everyone hanging on her every word, Ava would be sitting on the sidelines--with some boy usually whispering in her pretty brown ears. Ava was a little shorter than her sister, but had a lighter skin tone, longer hair, and the prettiest pink lips anyone had ever seen. She was lovely, and her body was shapelier than average at her age.Realizing that her sister was right, Ava cleared her throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201c; she said, avoiding her sister&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;I should have listened to you, Jada. But Derek is so cute.&#x201d;Jada grinned at Ava and shook her head. &#x201c;He is cute. But, not as cute as Marlon.&#x201d;&#x201d;Whatever!&#x201d; Ava laughed, and shoved her sister playfully. They walked the rest of the way home giggling about how they&#x2019;d spent their afternoon. Derek and Marlon were the cutest boys in school, and they just happened to be cousins. Both of them hustled, despite their young ages, and they were well-known around the way. Jada and Ava had spent many a giggle-filled night talking about how two boys that fine had to fall from the same family tree. All the girls in school wanted Derek and Marlon. They were always fly, always had dough. But despite all the girls who wanted them, they wanted Jada and Ava. So when the opportunity arose for the four of them to be alone, the girls had jumped at the chance. They&#x2019;d met at Marlon&#x2019;s house and proceeded to spend several unsupervised hours with the boys of their dreams. For the next few hours, both girls were on cloud nine, as they French-kissed and were caressed by the two cutest boys in school. Now it was almost 8:30, and they had a lot of explaining to do. Their time with Derek and Marlon had been a welcome distraction from the ugliness they experienced both at home and in their neighborhood.The crack epidemic had taken over ghettos across the country, and Brooklyn was the worst. Bodies showed up every night up and down Flatbush Avenue, and throughout the borough of Brooklyn. Gunshots rang out, and everybody knew the drill. They&#x2019;d hit the deck and wait till it ceased, wondering if this time the victim was someone they knew. Crack vials littered the sidewalks, the stairwells, and even the schoolyards. Drug dealers fought over corners, and over customers. Car radios blared rap music at all hours of the day and night. This became the canvas of the girls&#x2019; young lives as they journeyed toward adulthood.They arrived at their building, and entered the littered lobby. They rode up on the urine-scented elevator, the walls lined with tracks from spit. Garbage littered the elevator floor, and for the millionth time both girls wished they lived anywhere except the projects. As soon as Jada turned the key in their apartment door, she could hear the yelling coming from the kitchen. It was going to be a long night. J.D. was in the middle of one of his tirades. Both sisters knew that the night would end in the usual manner--with their mother balled up on the floor, crying as she tried to block her man&#x2019;s kicks and punches.Life hadn&#x2019;t always been so hopeless for the girls. Edna Ford had gotten married and given birth to Jada and Ava when she was fresh out of high school. Their father, Sheldon Ford, a man five years older than Edna, married her when she was very young and easily manipulated. Sheldon had been the hardworking, financially stable father and husband that every woman dreams of. Edna had stayed home and cooked and cleaned, while Sheldon went out every day and worked as a truck driver, in and out of state. Jada grew up adoring her father. It was easy to do, since Sheldon had been such a handsome, strong, and charismatic man. Whenever Sheldon was away--often for days at a time driving his truck--Edna seemed eager, almost anxious for his return. She had a hard time making decisions on her own, or thinking for herself. And Jada sensed this early on. She could tell that her mother was not comfortable in a position of authority, that Edna needed Sheldon&#x2019;s input and his direction. This was evident in everything, from selecting new furniture for the house to which dress she should wear when they went out. Edna always sought Sheldon&#x2019;s approval. So whenever he returned it was a relief for both Edna and her daughters, all of them thirsting for the comfort they found in Daddy&#x2019;s presence. Edna loved and doted on her husband. She knew that she was lucky to have a man like Sheldon. Someone who wasn&#x2019;t in and out of jail, a man who worked hard and looked good doing it. What Edna didn&#x2019;t know was that Sheldon was living a double life, and was secretly seeing other women.He left exactly four years after Ava was born. It was her birthday, and they were having guests to celebrate their baby girl&#x2019;s special day. Jada and Ava had been decked out in their best dresses, and all the mothers from the neighborhood had brought their children to the party. Edna had been so busy flaunting her well-furnished home and her beautiful daughters in front of the jealous women from the block that she never realized so many of them had already slept with her husband.Ava was sitting shyly in the corner at her own birthday party while Jada was center stage, dancing her heart out with all the other kids. Edna was so distracted, as she soothingly encouraged Ava to join in the fun, that she only half acknowledged Sheldon when he told her that he was going to the store to get some more soda. Edna had waved him off and mumbled something about them needing napkins too. But Sheldon never returned. And Jada had watched her mother make feeble excuses for the rest of the night about where her man was. She entertained their guests while discreetly wringing her hands, eager for his return. But Sheldon never came back. Long after the guests were gone and the house was clean, he was nowhere to be found. When he finally had the decency to call his wife, he told her that he&#x2019;d found somebody else with whom the grass seemed greener. And he never looked back. Edna had been heartbroken. She had stayed in her room and lain in her bed, crying for days at a time. Jada had been the one to put on a brave face and shield her younger sister from her mother&#x2019;s sobs, by keeping Edna&#x2019;s bedroom door closed and turning on the living room stereo in order to drown out their mother&#x2019;s crying. While Ava asked where their daddy had gone, and why Mommy wouldn&#x2019;t come out of her room, Jada changed the subject and made sandwiches for her sister. Despite being a mere six years old, Jada knew in her heart that their daddy wasn&#x2019;t coming back. She knew that Sheldon had walked away, never to return. And she thought she must have been the most heartbroken of all. Yet she kept her game face on and played the role of the rock for both her sister and her own mother. Jada did a lot of growing up, and would later wonder who had been the parent and who had been the child.Sheldon had met lots of women in the course of driving in and out of state. But he fell in love with a woman who didn&#x2019;t want or have the patience for kids. Despite the voice in his head telling him that he was wrong, he abandoned his own daughters and began a life with the woman he couldn&#x2019;t live without. But it turned out that the woman wasn&#x2019;t quite divorced, and in an unexpected altercation, he was killed by her jealous husband with a gunshot to the heart.

Along with a delightful group of fellow fern aficionados&#x2014;mathematicians, poets, artists, and assorted botanists and birders&#x2014;he embarks on an exploration of Southern Mexico, a region that is also rich in human history and culture. He muses on the origins of chocolate and mescal, pre-Columbian culture and hallucinogens, the vibrant sights and sounds of the marketplace, and the peculiar passions of botanists. What other species would comb ancient Zapotec ruins on their hands and knees, searching for a new type of fern?

Now, one of&nbsp;&nbsp;America's foremost psychologists and a pioneer in&nbsp;&nbsp;self-esteem development offers a step-by-step guide to&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthening your sense of self-worth. Here are&nbsp;&nbsp;simple, straightforward and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>effective</i> techniques that will dramatically improve&nbsp;&nbsp;the way you think and feel about yourself.

In addition to his extensive work as a writer, Branden worked as a lecturer, therapist, and corporate consultant specializing in assisting modern businesses employ the principles of self-esteem to achieve greater levels of success. He also the founded The Branden Institute for Self-Esteem, a counseling center in Los Angeles, California. He died in 2014.Chapter 1<br> The Importance of Self-Esteem<br> &nbsp;<br> How we feel about ourselves crucially affects virtually every aspect of our experience, from the way we function at work, in love, in sex, to the way we operate as parents, to how high in life we are likely to rise. Our responses to events are shaped by who and what we think we are. The dramas of our lives are the reflections of our most private visions of ourselves. Thus, self-esteem is the key to success or failure.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is also the key to understanding ourselves and others.<br> &nbsp;<br> Apart from problems that are biological in origin, I cannot think of a single psychological difficulty&#x2014;from anxiety and depression, to fear of intimacy or of success, to alcohol or drug abuse, to underachievement at school or at work, to spouse battering or child molestation, to sexual dysfunctions or emotional immaturity, to suicide or crimes of violence&#x2014;that is not traceable to poor self-esteem. Of all the judgments we pass, none is as important as the one we pass on ourselves. Positive self-esteem is a cardinal requirement of a fulfilling life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Let us understand what self-esteem is. It has two components: a feeling of personal competence and a feeling of personal worth. In other words, self-esteem is the sum of self-confidence and self-respect. It reflects your implicit judgment of your ability to cope with the challenges of your life (to understand and master your problems) and of your right to be happy (to respect and stand up for your interests and needs).<br> &nbsp;<br> To have high self-esteem is to feel confidently appropriate to life, that is, competent and worthy in the sense just indicated. To have low self-esteem is to feel inappropriate to life; wrong, not about this issue or that, but wrong as a person. To have average self-esteem is to fluctuate between feeling appropriate and inappropriate, right and wrong as a person, and to manifest these inconsistencies in behavior&#x2014;sometimes acting wisely, sometimes acting foolishly&#x2014;thereby reinforcing the uncertainty.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ability to develop a healthy self-confidence and self-respect is inherent in our natures, since our ability to think is the basic source of our competence, and the fact that we are alive is the basic source of our right to strive for happiness. Ideally, everyone should enjoy a high level of self-esteem, experiencing both intellectual self-trust and a strong sense that happiness is appropriate. Unfortunately, however, a great many people do not. Many people suffer from feelings of inadequacy, insecurity, self-doubt, guilt, and fear of full participation in life&#x2014;a vague sense that &#x201c;I am not enough.&#x201d; These feelings are not always readily recognized and acknowledged, but they are there.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the process of growing up, and in the process of living itself, it is all too easy for us to become alienated from (or never to form) a positive self-concept. We may never reach a joyful vision of ourselves because of negative input from others, or because we have defaulted on our own honesty, integrity, responsibility and self-assertiveness, or because we have judged our own actions with inadequate understanding and compassion.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, self-esteem is always a matter of degree. I have never known anyone who was entirely lacking in positive self-esteem, nor have I known anyone who was incapable of growing in self-esteem.<br> &nbsp;<br> To grow in self-esteem is to grow in the conviction that one is competent to live and worthy of happiness, and therefore to face life with greater confidence, benevolence, and optimism, which help us to reach our goals and experience fulfillment. To grow in self-esteem is to expand our capacity for happiness.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we understand this, we can appreciate the fact that all of us have a stake in cultivating our self-esteem. It is not necessary to hate ourselves before we can learn to love ourselves more; we do not have to feel inferior in order to want to feel more confident. We do not have to be miserable to want to expand our capacity for joy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The higher our self-esteem, the better equipped we are to cope with life&#x2019;s adversities; the more resilient we are, the more we resist pressure to succumb to despair or defeat.<br> &nbsp;<br> The higher our self-esteem, the more likely we are to be creative in our work, which means the more successful we are likely to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The higher our self-esteem, the more ambitious we tend to be, not necessarily in a career or financial sense, but in terms of what we hope to experience in life&#x2014;emotionally, creatively, and spiritually.<br> &nbsp;<br> The higher our self-esteem, the more likely we are to form nourishing rather than destructive relationships, since like is drawn to like, health is attracted to health, and vitality and expansiveness are more appealing than emptiness and exploitiveness.<br> &nbsp;<br> The higher our self-esteem, the more inclined we are to treat others with respect, benevolence, and goodwill, since we do not perceive them as threats, do not feel as &#x201c;strangers and afraid in a world [we] never made&#x201d; (quoting A. E. Housman&#x2019;s poem), and since self-respect is the foundation of respect for others.<br> &nbsp;<br> The higher our self-esteem, the more joy we experience in the sheer fact of being, of waking up in the morning, of living inside our own bodies.<br> &nbsp;<br> These are the rewards of self-confidence and self-respect.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Honoring the Self I discuss in detail why such correlations exist. But I trust it is clear that if we wish to expand our positive possibilities, and thereby transform the quality of our existence, the art of nurturing our self-esteem is the place to begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Let us go still more deeply into the meaning of self-esteem.<br> &nbsp;<br> Self-esteem, on whatever level, is an intimate experience; it resides in the core of our being. It is what I think and feel about myself, not what someone else thinks or feels about me.<br> &nbsp;<br> As children our self-confidence and self-respect can be nurtured or undermined by adults&#x2014;according to whether we are respected, loved, valued, and encouraged to trust ourselves. But even in our early years our own choices and decisions play a crucial role in the level of self-esteem we ultimately develop. We are far from being merely passive receptacles of other people&#x2019;s views of us. And in any case, whatever our upbringing may have been, as adults the matter is in our own hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one else can breathe for us, no one else can think for us, no one else can thrust self-trust and self-love upon us.<br> &nbsp;<br> I can be loved by my family, my mate, and my friends and yet not love myself. I can be admired by my associates and yet regard myself as worthless. I can project an image of assurance and poise that fools virtually everyone and yet secretly tremble with a sense of my inadequacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> I can fulfill the expectations of others and yet fail my own; I can win every honor and yet feel I have accomplished nothing; I can be adored by millions and yet wake up each morning with a sickening sense of fradulence and emptiness.<br> &nbsp;<br> To attain &#x201c;success&#x201d; without attaining positive self-esteem is to be condemned to feeling like an impostor anxiously awaiting exposure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as the acclaim of others does not create our self-esteem, neither do knowledge, skill, material possessions, marriage, parenthood, charitable endeavors, sexual conquests, or face lifts. These things can sometimes make us feel better about ourselves temporarily, or more comfortable in particular situations; but comfort is not self-esteem.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tragedy is that so many people look for self-confidence and self-respect everywhere except within themselves, and so they fail in their search. We shall see that positive self-esteem is best understood as a kind of spiritual attainment&#x2014;that is, as a victory in the evolution of consciousness. When we begin to understand self-esteem in this way, as a condition of consciousness, we appreciate the foolishness of believing that if we can only manage to make a positive impression on others we will then enjoy positive self-regard. We will stop telling ourselves: If only I get one more promotion; if only I become a wife and mother; if only I am perceived to be a good provider; if only I can afford a bigger car; if only I can write one more book, acquire one more company, one more lover, one more award, one more acknowledgment of my &#x201c;selflessness&#x201d;&#x2014;then I will really feel at peace with myself. We will realize that since the quest is irrational, the longing will always be for &#x201c;one more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If self-esteem is the judgment that I am appropriate to life, the experience of competence and worth&#x2014;if self-esteem is self-affirming consciousness, a mind that trusts itself&#x2014;no one can generate this experience except myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> When we appreciate the true nature of self-esteem, we see that it is not competitive or comparative.<br> &nbsp;<br> Genuine self-esteem is not expressed by self-glorification at the expense of others, or by the quest to make oneself superior to others or to diminish others so as to elevate oneself. Arrogance, boastfulness, and the overestimation of our abilities reflect inadequate self-esteem rather than, as some people imagine, too much self-esteem.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the most significant characteristics of healthy self-esteem is that it is the state of one who is not at war either with himself or with others.<br> &nbsp;<br> The importance of healthy self-esteem lies in the fact that it is the foundation of our ability to respond actively and positively to the opportunities of life&#x2014;in work, in love, and in play. It is also the foundation of that serenity of spirit that makes possible the enjoyment of life.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Welcome to Moonlight Harbor (A Moonlight Harbor Novel, 1)</h2><p><strong>USA TODAY</strong><strong><em> bestselling author Sheila Roberts returns with a brand-new series set on the charming Washington coast</em></strong><br><br>Once happily married, Jenna Jones is about to turn forty, and this year for her birthday&#x2014;lucky her&#x2014;she&#x2019;s getting a divorce.

In astronomy, the luminosity of an object is the total amount of energy that it emits across all wavelengths, measured over time. It is often used when referring to stars, whose luminosity will depend on their size, and mass, and temperature. Brightness (formally known as apparent brightness), although related to luminosity, varies wildly depending on the location, positioning, or proximity of the observer. Something with great luminosity might, to us, seem nothing more than a fleck of dust, only because it&#x2019;s sitting and burning and minding its own business unthinkably far away. For a human standing on the surface of the planet, the brightest object is the nighttime star Sirius, primarily because it is a mere 8.6 light-years away. It is by no means the most luminous star, though, and even within the constellation containing Sirius, Canis Major, at least three other stars are thousands of times more luminous; they only appear fainter as they are so much farther away. Even the most ordinary of stars seem noteworthy from where we are, and so we point at those pins of ancient light, nod at the brightness, assign them names and neighbors. In February 1963, a Dutch astronomer named Maarten Schmidt was analyzing an unusually bright speck in the sky, slowly realizing that while he had thought it might be a nearby star, it actually was something entirely different: not close at all, but rather 2 billion light-years away, and in order for it to still be so bright at that distance it would have to be more than anything known at the time. Schmidt named this object a &#x201c;quasar,&#x201d; which is short for &#x201c;quasi-stellar object,&#x201d; or QSO. Named 3C 273, it is located in the constellation Virgo, and optically speaking is the brightest of the bunch. In the fifty or so years since this discovery, hundreds of thousands of quasars have been observed. They remain some of the most astonishing things in the universe, and are perhaps the most luminous of all. Lying in the middle of galaxies, galaxies with vast black holes that can be billions of times larger than the sun, the temperature of a quasar can reach tens of millions of degrees, and their immense radiation means they outshine everything around them, drowning out all nearby stars. But they are not unchanging, and while one minute a quasar might be blinding, ten years later it can have become just another average galaxy. In astronomical terms, ten years is the briefest of moments, but it is events and observations such as this that lead to a better understanding of a black hole&#x2019;s appetite: how they can be ravenously hungry one moment and completely disinterested the next.</p><h2>The House That Cleans Itself: 8 Steps to Keep Your Home Twice as Neat in Half the Time</h2><p><p>The ultimate guide for the housekeeping-impaired!

Scott "The Piano Guy" Houston teaches you to play the way the pros play, in a style enormously simpler than traditional classical piano and with an absolute minimum of note-reading. By focusing on playing the melody with the right hand (one note at a time) and simple chords with the left hand, Houston gives you the tools you need for a lifetime of musical enjoyment. Best of all, your tour guide to this adventure forces you to have fun along the way!</p><p><strong>Scott "The Piano Guy" Houston</strong>'s background combines a degree from Indiana University with over fifteen years of experience in the music industry. From teaching to playing professionally to managing a music publishing company, he has been a part of many aspects of the music world. Realizing that most students do not aspire to become concert pianists, but rather want to enjoy being able to sit down at a keyboard and play their favorite music, he has taught thousands of students successfully at universities and colleges nationwide.Book Excerpt #1 <p>Here is some good, and equally true, news. If you want to learn how to play non-classical popular style piano, you simply need to learn a basic set of rules and techniques and you can start sounding fairly hip right away (as in hours or days, not years). Will you want to keep learning and playing and otherwise keep getting better for the next 5 to 10 years? YES! But, you'll be having the time of your life on the way there. Why? Because you'll be playing instead of practicing. </p><p>Now I'm sure you're saying to yourself, "Sounds great, Scott, but how can it be that easy to teach?" Well, the reason playing non-classical piano is so much easier to teach someone is that it removes the "A-Number-1 Top-of-the-List" reason that most people never learn to play classical piano at any level of proficiency. That, my friends, is notation reading. </p><p>You know, getting your hands around a piano is a relatively simple thing to do compared to most other instruments. It's all target practice! Seriously, as long as you get your finger over the right note at the right time, you are good to go. You can't control if the piano is in or out of tune. You don't have to worry about taking a deep enough breath. Pianists don't have to worry about getting their mouths in some correctly contorted position (known as an embouchure) like horn players. Think about poor brass players who's lips get all swollen and puffy and hurt like crazy when they play high notes. Or how about oboe players who must be (at least I know I would be�) concerned about their brains squeezing out their ears when they play. Or how about any of you who have had sons or daughters start out on a reed instrument like a clarinet or saxophone. I mean, a better goose call has yet to be invented than the first week of a reed players musical life. </p><p>In exchange for the extremely difficult task of dealing with a tough instrument, everyone else gets totally bailed out when it comes to note reading. With just a few exceptions (like string players every now and then) all they ever have to read is one note at a time and only in one clef! Must be nice! Think about traditional piano music; multiple notes at one time, in two clefs (which are different), with two hands. It's a brain buster for sure! </p><p>The thing that makes playing piano such a killer is not the playing, it's the note reading. Piano players (or wannabe players) are strange in this way; I bet if I had 100 piano students look at traditional sheet music (that I knew had notation in it tougher than they could read), 95% of them would say "Scott, I can't play that." That is in contrast with the truth of the matter, which is that they should have said "Scott, I can't read that." Those students wouldn't have any idea whether or not they could physically get their hands over the keyboards in such a way as to play what that notation was recording. I'm sure they never got remotely close to testing their physical abilities on a keyboard. That is because they (like the overwhelming majority of failed "lesson takers") never got to be good enough notation readers to even come close to testing their mechanical abilities. </p><p>It may seem like a hair splitting distinction, but it is really a huge issue that you must come to grip with, that being: READING NOTATION DOES NOT EQUAL GOOD PIANO PLAYING. Can both coincide (good reading and good playing)? Sure, and I applaud those who have toiled to a position where that is the case! But two other possibilities are found in abundance as well. One being, great notation readers who can't play their way out of a paper bag. The other being, those that can't read worth a hoot, who are GREAT players. </p><p>It is that last description that is of major intrigue to us in this book. I hope you are all quietly thinking to yourself, "You mean I can learn how to play piano without becoming a great note reader?" The answer is a resounding YES!!! We will have to acquire a very basic amount of notation reading skill. But the extremely difficult task of honing your note reading skills that classical students are required to endure for years and years is totally nonexistent as a requirement to playing non-classical piano. </p><p>In summary, I reiterate that what you will learn in this book is NOT appropriate for use in playing classical style piano. But, always keep in mind the other side of the coin. If you use the rules of classical piano to play non-classical music, you too will be playing incorrectly. Worse yet, you will be doomed to sound like a corny sheet music player, not like a pro. I'll show you how to sound like a pro...</p></p><h2>literally show me a healthy person</h2><p>Darcie Wilder's&nbsp;<i>literally show me a healthy person&nbsp;</i>is a careful confession soaking in saltwater, a size B control top jet black pantyhose dragged over a skinned knee and slipped into unlaced doc martens.

It&#39;s just a dead, empty tradition of the past.&#34; This is the overwhelming consensus among young people today, and it has resulted in an ever-widening cultural divide between the secular youth culture and the Church. Much of what was formerly regarded as the Christian world is leaving its roots behind and is dominated by secularism and relativism. The Bible is no longer considered the moral compass, but rather everyone is free to decide for themselves what is right and wrong. As followers of Jesus, it&#39;s clear that we need to respond to this - but how? Jesus in the Secular World combines vivid illustrations from over a decade of front-line ministry with practical principles that will encourage and equip any follower of Jesus to relevantly reach those who would not come to the Church for answers.</p><p></p><h2>The Only Sales Guide You&#39;ll Ever Need</h2><p><b>The <i>USA Today</i> bestseller by the star sales speaker and author of The Sales Blog that reveals how all salespeople can attain huge sales success through strategies backed by extensive research and experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> </b>Anthony Iannarino never set out to become a salesman, let alone a sales manager, speaker, coach, or writer of the most prominent blog about the art and science of great selling.

And, keeping track of that inventory these days is no simple task. It requires a system-an "external brain"-to keep yourself oriented to be doing the right thing, at the right time.<br><br>-David Allen, author of Getting Things Done<br><br>What's the secret to being a successful salesperson? Or a great one?<br><br>It's not the product or service you sell. Neither is it your competition, the market environment, your price structure, evolving technology, or any such thing.<br><br>It's you. Your ability to manage yourself, to exert self-discipline, spells the difference between success and failure in sales.<br><br>Let me rephrase that: self-discipline is the difference between success and failure. Yes, there are a lot of other components of the salesperson's mind-set, skill set, and tool kit, but without strong self-discipline, those don't matter one whit.<br><br>Most people don't fail because they can't do something. They fail because they aren't willing to do what it takes to succeed. This means they aren't willing to discipline themselves. That's why self-discipline, or what I call "me management," is the cornerstone element of sales success. Unless you are willing to take the actions that lead to success, in sales or anything else, it will always elude you.<br><br>Self-discipline is the fundamental attribute of all successful people. It allows them to take action even when they don't want to. It makes it possible for them to focus their time and energy on what must be done now, without procrastinating. It gives them the strength to pass up a little pleasure now in exchange for what they really want later. In sales, self-discipline is what separates the great from the mediocre.<br><br>It is vital that you take this first element seriously. Don't skip ahead to later chapters, thinking that there is greater value in learning about closing or prospecting. If you work on this one element, if you perfect it, all the others will fall more easily into place.<br><br>The First Commitment<br><br>Sales is all about gaining commitments from your prospects. But the most important commitments are those you make to yourself. And you are constantly making commitments to yourself, whether or not you realize it.<br><br>For example, you know you need to invest your time prospecting. But the little chime that lets you know an e-mail has arrived has just grabbed your attention again. So instead of making the calls you need to make, you spend an hour looking at your in-box. You've just made a commitment.<br><br>The biggest and best prospects in your territory already have someone selling them the same thing you're selling. You know you need to nurture these relationships, and you understand that it will take a well-coordinated, long-term plan to get one of these dream clients to agree to see you-just to see you! But you get caught up in office watercooler chatter, and time slips away. You've made another commitment.<br><br>It's time to visit a prospective client, but you've been so busy with other things that you didn't review your notes and prepare for the call. Now you are walking into the most important interaction you will ever have with this client without a plan and without some of the things you promised to provide. Yet another commitment.<br><br>What are you committing to when you skip your prospecting calls, fail to nurture your relationships, and neglect to prepare?<br><br>You are certainly not committing to yourself, your future, and your success. And since you did not make and keep these and other commitments, success will be but a dream for you.<br><br>Where There's a Will<br><br>I discovered the power of self-discipline early in my career. One experience that I've never forgotten occurred on my first day of work after leaving Los Angeles and rejoining the family business in Columbus. That morning, my sales manager walked up to my desk with two minions in tow and dropped a stack of papers in front of me. "These are our accounts, and you are not to call on any of them," she said.<br><br>I looked at the stack; there were pages and pages of company names. I was surprised at how many client accounts our little firm had already won. "We are serving all of these companies?" I asked, impressed.<br><br>"No!" she snapped. "But we are calling on these companies. You are not to call on any of them."<br><br>Now I understood: "we" didn't include me.<br><br>At 8:00 a.m. the next day, I closed the door to my office and started calling all of the nonexcluded companies listed in the business section of the phone book. I made cold calls until I went to lunch, and when I came back, I made cold calls until the end of the day. I did that the next day and the next and the next. My consistent, disciplined effort was rewarded with face-to-face appointments. The more calls I made, the more appointments I booked. The more appointments I booked, the more business I won. Within six months, I was the sales leader. After twelve months, my sales numbers were higher than those of the rest of the sales team combined. Soon after, the sales manager and her minions left the company.<br><br>I am not saying that I was a better salesperson than the other members of the sales team. I am not even saying that I was better at cold calling; I absolutely wasn't. I am saying that disciplined action made the difference between my results and theirs. While I was making calls, my sales manager and her reps were chatting about their weekends, the television shows they had watched the night before, and finding ways to pretend to be busy with existing clients. They were doing anything but prospecting.<br><br>My success resulted from nothing more than a willingness to commit to consistent and purposeful action. I forced myself to make thousands of cold calls and, in doing so, I discovered hidden treasures on almost every page of the phone book. It turned out that many of the most lucrative accounts in the city weren't the biggest or best-known companies. They were smaller ones that would never have been included in the list that the sales manager dropped on my desk and told me not to touch.<br><br>The sales manager left without understanding what I had done or why I had succeeded. But I learned a lesson that has served me well ever since: self-discipline is essential to sales success. Your good intentions are worthless unless they are coupled with disciplined action.<br><br>Reaping the Rewards of Me Management<br><br>Effective self-discipline, or me management, depends on three qualities:<br><br>1. Willpower: You will yourself to act without the prospect of an immediate reward. Countless distractions can divert your attention from what you need to do. It takes willpower to ignore them and stick to your work, which is sometimes difficult and mundane but always important.<br><br>2. Fortitude: You display courage in the face of adversity. You often hear "no," but you do not let that discourage you. You find the strength to keep going. You are committed to your chosen course of action, come hell or high water.<br><br>3. Accountability: You hold yourself accountable for your own results and keep the commitments you make to yourself as if they were commitments made to others. If, for example, you schedule an appointment to meet your dream client, you don't dare miss it or go in unprepared. In fact, unless and until you learn to keep the commitments you make to yourself, you will fail to be accountable for the results you promise to your clients. As Stephen R. Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, put it, "Private victories precede public victories."<br><br>From Three Come More<br><br>Willpower, fortitude, and accountability are the three qualities upon which me management depends. Once you develop these qualities and become a master of self-discipline, you reap many rewards, including the ability to be honest and courageous and to act with integrity. You also discover that greater future rewards are won by delaying gratification. Here's why:<br><br>Honesty: It takes willpower to tell the truth, especially when the truth hurts you. We were designed to avoid pain and seek pleasure. Because being honest can sometimes cause you pain, it can require fortitude to act in spite of the personal discomfort, risk, or loss that you may suffer. It's easy to sidestep the difficult conversation or avoid telling the truth, especially when something is your fault and owning up to it may damage your relationships. That's where self-discipline comes in. It allows you to be honest when evasion is the more comfortable choice. And your honesty, your ability to deal with the uncomfortable, makes you more trustworthy and more credible to your clients.<br><br>Courage: Courage isn't the absence of fear. It's taking action even though you are gripped by fear. Courage requires the self-discipline to put yourself in harm's way and ignore the internal dialogue that tells you to retreat to safety. Self-discipline gives you the power to be courageous and stand tall, even when you are quaking with fear. It shows that you are committed to something greater, to a higher purpose, and that you are willing to keep that commitment regardless of the price you have to pay.<br><br>Integrity: Consistently walking your talk-that is, saying what you mean and meaning what you say-can be tough. But that's the definition of integrity. Your word is your bond, and you can be counted on. It takes willpower, fortitude, and a strong sense of accountability to do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. Sometimes it's difficult, and sometimes you just don't feel like it. Too often, pleasant distractions threaten to derail you. But self-discipline allows you to keep your word and always walk your talk.<br><br>Greater future rewards: The most important benefit of self-discipline is achieving greater rewards down the line by delaying present gratification. You reap nothing now, except maybe some pain, in exchange for a higher return later. For example, instead of luxuriating in the pleasure of nine minutes of extra sleep, you delay that gratification, get up when you should, and arrive at your appointment on time and well prepared, putting yourself head and shoulders above many of your competitors. Or, instead of being dishonest with a client about a mistake you've made and avoiding a little pain right now, you tell the truth, endure the discomfort, and are rewarded later with the client's trust and respect.<br><br>In short, willpower, fortitude, and accountability lead to self-discipline. And self-discipline gives you the wherewithal to be honest, act courageously and with integrity, and delay gratification for better returns later. This is why it's so important to master self-discipline, as it's the cornerstone of all the attributes that allow you to succeed.<br><br>Applying Self-Discipline to Routine Maintenance<br><br>We humans are novelty-seeking creatures, attracted to anything that is new, interesting, or exciting. In sales, it's true that some new tools and ideas can revolutionize your efforts and produce exciting results. These are certainly worth looking into. However, much of your success depends on simple, routine maintenance-that is, keeping your nose to the grindstone.<br><br>Many salespeople shy away from routine maintenance because it's not terribly exciting or new, and it guarantees that they'll hear "no" over and over again. But routine maintenance does produce predictable results, especially over the long run. It is the first area in which self-discipline must be applied.<br><br>The Routine Maintenance of Prospecting<br><br>Here's a basic law of the sales universe: the more desperate you are to fill your pipeline with opportunities, the more difficult it is to do so. You must be vigilant about prospecting on a daily basis so that you don't become desperate. Sporadic prospecting leads to stress, missed commitments, and anxiety that forces you to take on something less than your dream client. But when you are self-disciplined, with the willpower and fortitude to keep prospecting day after day, week after week, month after month, you are practically guaranteed a pipeline full of opportunities.<br><br>Make the commitment to attend to the routine maintenance of prospecting every day. In sales, you must continually open new relationships. Remember, no opportunity is ever closed that hasn't first been opened.<br><br>The Routine Maintenance of Nurturing<br><br>To succeed in sales, you must develop the necessary relationships before you need them.<br><br>Nurturing your dream clients is perhaps the most important activity you can undertake in pursuit of success-but nurturing and urgency don't mix. Once you find yourself desperate for opportunities, it's already too late to develop them. There is no way to rush relationships, and there is no way to rush trust. Both trust and relationships require time and careful, determined, and active attention.<br><br>Nurturing relationships, like prospecting, shouldn't be done sporadically if you want to produce predictable, profitable results. Nurturing as a part of routine maintenance builds trust and solidifies the relationships you need, before you need them.<br><br>The Routine Maintenance of Existing Client Relationships<br><br>You made promises to your existing clients back when they were just your dream clients, and you have since kept those promises. But that's not enough. Resting on your laurels is a recipe for disaster.<br><br>When your clients' needs change, or when the world throws something unexpected at them, you need to be there either to help them overcome the obstacles or capitalize on these new opportunities. Not being there and not proactively working to anticipate and adapt to their changing needs invites client dissatisfaction-the same kind of dissatisfaction that created an opportunity for you to work with your dream client in the first place.<br><br>Routine maintenance of your existing relationships demonstrates to your clients that you are a proactive partner for the long term and that you care enough always to walk your talk.<br><br>Prospecting, nurturing, and remaining proactive with existing clients are just a few of the areas that require a disciplined routine of maintenance. You could add other items, such as following up, updating your sales-force automation or customer-relationship manager, and sending thank-you cards. Take care of routine daily maintenance, and routine daily maintenance will take good care of you.<br><br>Five Ways to Develop Self-Discipline<br><br>Wait.

Also included are tips on how to incorporate gluten-free baking into a busy weekly schedule, and the book explains why baking wholesome and delicious breads, muffins, cakes, and other items is so important for emotional and physical well-being.<br></p><p>My philosophy about gluten-free baking is that it should be simple. Most gf bakers I know don't want to reach for six different flours every time they bake- and neither do I.&nbsp;Wheat bakers use only two flours- all purpose for cakes, pies, muffins and cookies, and bread flour for bread. I do the same: I have an all-purpose brown rice flour mix (extra finely ground brown rice flour, potato starch and tapioca starch) for my all purpose flour and the bread flour mix&nbsp;(millet, sorghum, potato starch, tapioca starch and corn starch)&nbsp;in this book for my breads.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy- and it increases your learning curve. If you use a different combination of flours each time you bake, how will you know what goes wrong- or right? Baking pros don't do this; that is how they become skilled in their craft.&nbsp;Moreover, wheat bakers enhance the taste and texture of their breads with other added flours (whole wheat, rye, etc.) and so do I. I recommend using whole grain teff and ground oatmeal (my favorites), Montina, amaranth, or quinoa. I give recommendations as to how to do this in the book.&nbsp;Annalise Roberts co-writes for the website foodphilosopher.com.

Many believers are contemplating in a fresh way what it means to take the Great Commission seriously. <em>Rediscovering Discipleship</em> takes the guesswork out of Christian maturity.</p><p>Based on insights gained from a decade of personally making disciples, author and pastor Robby Gallaty tackles the two hindrances that keep believers from getting involved in making disciples: ignorance and uncertainty. Since many believers have never been personally disciple, they have no model to guide them in discipling others. Their ignorance of the process fuels their uncertainty, which leaves them crippled from the start. With simple principles that are easy to apply, <em>Rediscovering Discipleship</em> provides readers with the tools to follow the Great Commission&#x2014;to go and actually make disciples who multiply and make disciples.</p><p>Gallaty begins with a brief historical overview of the discipleship ministries of influential theologians, preachers, and pastors from years past, and then identifies roadblocks that hinder believers from becoming disciples before offering a step-by-step process for readers to immediately get started on the path to effective disciple making.</p></p><p><p>Robby Gallaty (PhD, New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary) is the Senior Pastor of Long Hollow Baptist Church in Hendersonville, TN.

It also provides teacher-friendly sample lesson plans and miniroutines that the classroom teacher can readily understand and adapt. Finally, the book offers citations and descriptions of current research that educators can use to substantiate their strategy choices. Most educators are deeply concerned with literacy levels in their schools. Everyone is feeling the relentless pressure of high-stakes tests and the need to provide the highest levels of instruction. Specifically, this book is intended for elementary teachers of all kinds and levels, literacy coaches, interventionists, speech pathologists, other educational specialists, special education, bilingual, and Title I administrators, and even college and university professors who are looking for a research-based collection of intervention strategies as a resource in their classrooms. The intervention strategies are numbered one to forty and are grouped into seven sections: instruction, phonemic awareness, word identification, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, and reading a lot. Highly effective teachers often use these intervention strategies during whole-group instruction, since many of them will not only scaffold struggling readers but will also motivate and accelerate average and above-average students. Many of the interventions gain exponential power when implemented across a grade-level team or throughout the school. </p><p> </p><p>Benefits </p><ul><li>Scaffold challenging comprehension skills like inferencing, summarizing, and monitoring.</li> <li>Teach inference with sample lessons, using authentic text examples.</li> <li>Teach more vocabulary in less time with greater understanding and retention.</li><li>Increase the vocabulary and background knowledge of ELs and students with overall low vocabulary and language skills.</li><li>Read historical and up-to-date research citations to inform and support your intervention decisions.</li><li>Use the problem/solution table of contents to help you locate the precise strategy for a student s problem.</li><li>Discover more than 30 sample lessons with step-by-step instructions and teaching formats that include modeling, ways to build in student practice, and suggestions for keeping students engaged.</li><li>Learn routines to facilitate student practice of key reading skills.</li><li>Adopt interventions to help students cross the fluency bridge from word identification to comprehension.</li><li>Use the grade-level grid to help determine which strategies work best at specific grade levels.</li></ul> <p></p><p>Contents<br>1 Interventions for Improving Instruction<br>2 Interventions for Building Phonemic Awareness<br>3 Interventions for Building Word Identification Skills<br>4 Interventions for Building Fluency<br>5 Interventions for Building Vocabulary<br>6 Interventions for Facilitating Comprehension<br>7 Interventions for Teaching Students to Read a Lot</p></p><p><p><b>Elaine K.

With songs like "The Weight," "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," and "Up on Cripple Creek," he and his partners in The Band fashioned a music that has endured for decades, influencing countless musicians. <br><br>In this captivating memoir, written over five years of reflection, Robbie Robertson employs his unique storyteller&#x2019;s voice to weave together the journey that led him to some of the most pivotal events in music history. He recounts the adventures of his half-Jewish, half-Mohawk upbringing on the Six Nations Indian Reserve and on the gritty streets of Toronto; his odyssey at sixteen to the Mississippi Delta, the fountainhead of American music; the wild early years on the road with rockabilly legend Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks; his unexpected ties to the Cosa Nostra underworld; the gripping trial-by-fire &#x201c;going electric&#x201d; with Bob Dylan on his 1966 world tour, and their ensuing celebrated collaborations; the formation of the Band and the forging of their unique sound,&nbsp; culminating with history's most famous farewell concert, brought to life for all time in Martin Scorsese's great movie&nbsp;<i>The Last Waltz</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>This is the story of a time and place--the moment when rock 'n' roll became life, when legends like Buddy Holly and Bo Diddley criss-crossed the circuit of clubs and roadhouses from Texas to Toronto, when The Beatles, Hendrix, The Stones, and Warhol moved through the same streets and hotel rooms. It's the story of exciting change as the world tumbled through the '60s and early 70&#x2019;s, and a generation came of age, built on music, love and freedom. Above all, it's the moving story of the profound friendship between five young men who together created a new kind of popular music<b>.<br><br></b><i>Testimony </i>is Robbie Robertson&#x2019;s story, lyrical and true, as only he could tell it.</p><p><b>Robbie Robertson </b>was the guitarist and principal songwriter in the Band. He has produced many movie soundtracks for Martin Scorsese and others, and continues to record as a solo artist. His most recent record, <i>How to Become Clairvoyant</i>, came out in 2011.One<br><br>Stared out that train window<br><br>into the darkness,<br><br>till I near went stone blind.<br><br>I patted out a rhythm on my knee and smiled to myself. Sounded like a song from the very place I was headed.<br><br>I was spellbound, gazing out the train window at silhouettes of passing towns, a blur of nocturnal landscapes streaming by. Only the lights were changing. Small-town shadows stirring quietly, city neon coloring the night sky, one scene blending into another. I&#x2019;d been awake for many hours, but I was too wound up to sleep, too nervous. No, too buzzed! Me and that train were headed to the holy land of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, to the fountainhead, where the music I loved grew right out of the ground. This was a southbound train.<br><br>Spring, 1960, sixteen years old. I was traveling from Toronto, Ontario, to Fayetteville, Arkansas, toward my chance to try out for a job playing with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, the most wicked rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll band around. Ronnie was a big rockabilly recording artist, an amazing showman with a fresh, Frankie Laine&#x2013;type voice. The Hawks were a powerhouse band with perfect casting: they looked as authentic as they sounded&#x2014;sideburns, slicked-back hair, Memphis cool, one part country gentlemen, three parts southern wild men.<br><br>I kept staring out that passenger-car window in wonderment. I&#x2019;d never been this far from home before. Every time the train whistle blew, a chill ran through me. I tried to close my eyes but couldn&#x2019;t sleep. This was all too new, too unimaginable, too dreamlike, because, it occurred to me, people from my background didn&#x2019;t hardly know how to dream.<br><br>I remember the exact day it all turned around for me. I had just stepped out the side door of St. Theresa&#x2019;s Catholic grade school when it hit me: a vicious combination of driving wind, burning ice needles to the face, and blinding snow. You couldn&#x2019;t see more than a few feet in front of you.<br><br>The public school lay between my school and my house, and it was plainly understood that you took your life in your hands with the kids who went there if you cut through that school yard. But in this storm I had to risk it. The sleet was pushing me to the ground every few steps. So I set myself on a direct line for enemy territory, hoping none of those tough older kids could possibly be out in this blizzard; I thought, Even Eskimos don&#x2019;t go out in this.<br><br>But then I spotted a figure in the distance. I was already halfway across the school yard, no turning around now. As I got closer, I saw that the guy was big, and he was coming toward me. My heart was pounding from wading through the snow and being pushed back by the wind, and now from fear. He stumbled toward me, shielding his face with his scarf, like a mask. Oh man, what does he want? But when I reached him he merely stuck out his hand, holding a paper flyer, and gestured for me to take it. I blinked. Then I took the paper, stuffed it in my pocket, and kept moving.<br><br>By the time I reached the side door of my house I looked like a zombie who had just crossed the Arctic Circle. My mother was there to greet me, saying, &#x201c;Goodness, get in here, you must be frozen!&#x201d; While hanging up my coat, she pulled the flyer out of my pocket and read it aloud. &#x201c; &#x2018;Music Lessons: Accordion, Violin, Spanish and Hawaiian guitar.&#x2019; Oh, are you interested in taking lessons?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook the snow from my hair. &#x201c;Sure, anything if it means I never have to walk through a blizzard like this again.&#x201d; I was already drawn to music and now wondered if maybe it could help me find a way out of this frozen hellscape. &#x201c;But not accordion,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;Lawrence Welk and all . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed&#x2014;&#x201c;Okay, big dreamer&#x201d;&#x2014;and handed me a hot chocolate.<br><br>This was a turning point. I just didn&#x2019;t know it yet.<br><br>As the train idled at the Buffalo border crossing from Canada into the States, an immigration officer walking through the carriage asked me where I was going. It was a tricky moment: if I mentioned anything about a job, he&#x2019;d turn me back. I was trembling inside, but with a straight face I told him I was going to visit my brother and his family in Arkansas. He glanced at my birth certificate, then looked me dead in the eye. I just about swallowed my gum. After a pause he said, &#x201c;Have a good trip,&#x201d; and walked on.<br><br>As the train pulled away from the station and we crossed into the U.S., a wave of sadness came over me as I remembered what I&#x2019;d had to do to get the money to make my way south. Ronnie was looking to replace the guitarist or the bassist in his band, and he had told me, &#x201c;Come on down here and we&#x2019;ll see if it works out.&#x201d; This was my chance to convince him I was his man, so I thought it best not to ask him for any train money; nor did I want to bother my mother, who&#x2019;d given me a rough time about quitting school.<br><br>In the end there was only one thing to do: I had to sell my prized 1958 Fender Stratocaster with the original classic sunburst body. She was a real beauty. I&#x2019;d worked so hard to get her, saving up for months. But now I had to do whatever it took to get to Arkansas. I was on a mission but leaving that beloved Strat behind cut deep.<br><br>The first time I saw Ronnie and the Hawks perform, it was a revelation. I was only fifteen and Ronnie was playing the Dixie Arena in the west end of Toronto; the band I was in, the Suedes, was opening. We&#x2019;d been playing around Toronto for a few months, and opening for Ronnie Hawkins was the biggest thing we&#x2019;d ever done. After that night, I would look at music in a whole different light.<br><br>We had a strong lineup of players in our own group. Our drummer then was Pete &#x201c;the Bear&#x201d; De Remigis. He had a unique rolling-and-tumbling feel to his playing and hummed along unconsciously while he played, like a human kazoo. Pete Traynor, or &#x201c;Thumper,&#x201d; played bass. I&#x2019;d known him since I was thirteen, when we played together in the Rhythm Chords, the first band I ever hooked up with. We called him Thumper because of the way he manhandled the instrument. Pete would play and stare at you steadily, hardly ever looking at his hands. It made for a strange and powerful musical connection. Sometimes it got so intense I had to look away.<br><br>Scott &#x201c;Magoo&#x201d; Cushnie, our piano man, was twenty-one, and he had more musical training than the rest of us, as well as a sharp sense of humor and a fascinating inventory of slang words that he never shied from busting out. Some of them he invented and some could be attributed to his devotion to the popular, off-the-wall Bob and Ray radio show. I played lead guitar and sometimes sang, but for the Dixie Arena gig we had Johnny Rhythm on vocals. Johnny was part street hustler, part show-bar rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll impersonator, but the guy could sing like a bird. That night we played pretty good, and from the stage we could see Ronnie and his boys checking us out, which made us all reach a little higher. <br><br>But when the Hawk took the stage the whole atmosphere changed. The audience, which had been lingering around chatting, now crowded the front of the stage. Suddenly you could taste something raw and authentic in the air. The band was all dressed in black and red outfits. When they exploded into their first song, &#x201c;Wild Little Willie,&#x201d; the Hawk prowled the stage like a caged animal. He soared over Will &#x201c;Pop&#x201d; Jones&#x2019;s piano, growling a primitive war cry and miming a cranking motion behind Will&#x2019;s back like an organ-grinder winding up his monkey. Will was oblivious&#x2014;he was living inside the music, chewing gum to the rhythm, sweat flying, eyes crossed, head thrown back, hands pumping those ivories. Jimmy Ray &#x201c;Luke&#x201d; Paulman&#x2019;s Gretsch &#x201c;Country Gentleman&#x201d; guitar with its flat-wound strings poured on the rhythm. When Luke fired into a solo the Hawk had a chance to spin, flip, camel walk&#x2014;the original version of the moonwalk&#x2014;then tumble and land at Luke&#x2019;s feet. Toward the end of the solo, Ronnie would come back in singing like he was driving a mule train, and when he did the Hawks would settle into a slippery, swift locomotion behind his vocal.<br><br>Lefty Evans on bass was the only thing that kept the band grounded, or they might have become airborne and floated away. It was the most violent, dynamic, primitive rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll I had ever witnessed, and it was addictive.<br><br>In the center of it all was a young beam of light on drums. Teeth gleaming, laughing, bleached hair glowing, whole body shaking, drumsticks twirling, pushing those red sparkle drums with a hawk painted on the bass drum like a white tornado. It was the first time I saw Levon Helm, and I&#x2019;d never seen anything like it.<br><br>After the show I hung out while the Hawks packed up their guitars and drums, leaning in just to hear those southern accents, so rare up in Canada. I desperately wanted some of this mojo to rub off on me. They were playing at the club Le Coq d&#x2019;Or in Toronto for a couple more weeks, and I hung around them as much as I could without getting in the way, trying to make myself useful. Their road manager, Colin &#x201c;Boney&#x201d; McQueen, let me help out, doing stuff he didn&#x2019;t want to do, but I didn&#x2019;t care: this was biblical and I was fast becoming an apostle of the church of rockabilly.<br><br>One afternoon at the Warwick Hotel, where musicians, strippers, and small-time con men stayed in downtown Toronto, I overheard Ronnie say, &#x201c;Boys, I need some new songs. We&#x2019;re going in the studio next month.&#x201d;<br><br>A bell went off in my head. I had written some tunes for the little bands I&#x2019;d been in, but this could be a breakthrough. I ran home, grabbed my guitar, went to my room, and stayed up all night trying to write something that Ronnie could wrap his voice around&#x2014;hopefully something reminiscent of Gene Vincent&#x2019;s &#x201c;Woman Love.&#x201d;<br><br>By morning I had finished two songs. That day, I taught them to Johnny Rhythm, who could sing them in a style similar to Ron&#x2019;s, and soon we were playing them for the Hawk himself. He listened to both songs with a little smirk on his face, but when we finished he stood up and said, &#x201c;Play those again.&#x201d; Damned if they didn&#x2019;t sound better the second time around. Ron pointed a finger at me and declared, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to record both of them songs.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried not to get too excited in front of him, but inside I was overflowing. &#x201c;Not bad for a fifteen-year-old, right?&#x201d; I mumbled out of nervous joy. Ron just pointed his finger again and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be keeping an eye on you, boy. You might have some talent.&#x201d; When it came to finding good material this incredibly funny showman became stone serious, and it was fascinating to see him turn on a dime.<br><br>When Ronnie returned to Toronto a few months later, he brought his new album, Mr. Dynamo, and presented me with a sealed copy. &#x201c;Both your songs are on here, turned out pretty good.&#x201d; I tore open the LP and looked at the record label, thrilled to see their titles there&#x2014;&#x201c;Someone Like You&#x201d; and &#x201c;Hey Boba Lu.&#x201d; But when I looked for my name, I saw that the songwriting credit read, &#x201c;Robertson, Magil.&#x201d; Who was this &#x201c;Magil&#x201d; guy? What was this all about?<br><br>Ronnie laid it out for me: &#x201c;Magil&#x201d; was an alias used by a man named Morris Levy: the power behind Roulette Records, nightclub owner, business partner to the legendary rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll disc jockey Alan Freed, and mobster known for having a recording artist hung by the ankles out the window of his office building. &#x201c;See that Cadillac convertible parked down there?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;I can let go and drop you down into that car . . . or you can walk down there with the keys and drive away. All you have to do is sign the papers.&#x201d; When you recorded for Roulette, Morris Levy usually got a piece of the songwriting. &#x201c;Magil&#x201d; was his credit.<br><br>I started to protest but Ron said, &#x201c;Son, in this business there are certain things you don&#x2019;t even question. There are some ol&#x2019; boys in New York City you don&#x2019;t want to mess with.&#x201d; I had heard such stories of the ruthless rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll music business floating around, but I still couldn&#x2019;t help feeling like &#x201c;The Fool&#x201d; from the Sanford Clark song for not standing my ground.<br><br>A few days later, Ronnie came to me with an idea, one that would take me to New York City. If I could write songs for him, he said, maybe I also had an ear for other songs that would be good for him to record. Like many artists at that time, he didn&#x2019;t write much of his own music and was in constant search of new material. So with Levon doing most of the driving&#x2014;daytime, nighttime, it didn&#x2019;t matter to Levon&#x2014;we set off to New York. A friend of Ron&#x2019;s, Dallas Harms, who had written a couple of popular songs, came along. I felt as if I were part of an official song-search mission.<br><br>Crossing the bridge into Manhattan gave me chill bumps. I had never seen so many lights, so many movie theaters, so much neon, so many ladies of the night. I couldn&#x2019;t take it all in quick enough. We stayed at the Times Square Hotel on 42nd Street, and the next day Ronnie, with me in tow, hailed a cab. &#x201c;Is Levon coming?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, it&#x2019;s not his thing,&#x201d; Ronnie said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll play it better than anybody, but he ain&#x2019;t a song person, or he wouldn&#x2019;t still be singing &#x2018;Short Fat Fanny&#x2019; every night.&#x201d; Ron chuckled and slapped my knee as the taxi pulled away. &#x201c;Son, that&#x2019;s what I brought you for. We gotta find me some good material.&#x201d;<br><br>We headed for the Brill Building. With its high entranceway and gold doors, 1619 Broadway was like a temple for tunesmiths. It was the Tin Pan Alley of its day, just north of Times Square, the eleven-story heart of the music industry, a warren of small and large production offices humming with songwriters, musicians, music publishers, and producers. Inside, a guy from the record company took us around to the different music rooms making introductions: Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Otis Blackwell, and, oh yes, the outrageous singer-songwriter Titus Turner, who had just had his own hit on the King label with &#x201c;Return of Stagolee.&#x201d; They were all tickled by Ron&#x2019;s stories and cutups. &#x201c;Boys, I&#x2019;ll tell ya,&#x201d; he crowed, &#x201c;there ain&#x2019;t no difference between me and Elvis Presley except maybe looks and talent!&#x201d;</p><h2>God Dwells Among Us: Expanding Eden to the Ends of the Earth</h2><p><ul><li><em>Preaching's</em> 2014 Best Books for Preachers</li><li>2014 Best Missions-Oriented Biblical Study, from Byron Borger, Hearts and Minds Bookstore</li></ul> Just like we do today, the writers and chief actors of the Old Testament felt a deep longing for the presence of God. It is symbolized in the temple ruins, and before it the temple itself, and before that the ark of the covenant and the tabernacle that housed it, and before that the Garden of Eden. In response to this longing, God shares his ultimate mission, in which his people play a part: the expansion of Eden, the temple of God's presence, to all peoples throughout the earth. The temple has always been a source of rich scholarship and theological reflection, but what does it mean for the church's ongoing mission in the world? G. K. Beale and Mitchell Kim take temple theology off the bookshelf and bring it to our modern-day life, where the church is instructed and exhorted in its purpose. From Eden to the new Jerusalem, we are God's temple on the earth in our day, the firstfruits of the new creation. God has always desired to dwell among us; now the church must follow its missional call to extend the borders of God's kingdom and take his presence to the ends of the earth.</p><p><strong>G. K.

(R. Albert Mohler Jr., Preaching, "The Year's Best Books for Preachers," March/April 2015)<br><br>"This is biblical theology at its best: rich, allusive, big-picture building, and applicatory. Beale and Kim will help you see how the entire Bible centers on the theme of God's presence with his people&#x2015;and what that means for daily life." (Caleb Nelson, World Magazine, December 20, 2014)<br><br>"Beale and Kim carefully emphasize the practical impacts of the 'temple' in the church, making this book especially useful for pastors and teachers. This theme can shape how we see God's mission, our churches, and ourselves." (Elliot Ritzema, Bible Study Magazine, March/April 2015)<br><br>"God dwelling in the midst of his people: this staggering vision is the heart of God's covenantal purposes from Genesis to Revelation. <em>God Dwells Among Us</em> brings decades of scholarship on this topic to a wider audience. More than that, it shows how this major biblical theme is the engine of mission in the world today. This clear and compelling study is a real feast." (Michael Horton, J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California)<br><br>"In Scripture, God dwells not only up above the world but also among us, with us and within us. Our hearts long to hear more of God?s presence, his promise to be with us. One important way for us to understand God?s presence in Scripture is through its teaching about the temple and of Jesus as the true temple. Greg Beale has developed this theme cogently in scholarly writings. In <em>God Dwells Among Us</em> he and Mitchell Kim have made these ideas accessible to working pastors. It is a valuable aid to preaching and an excellent antidote to the feeling of loneliness that afflicts many today. I recommend it highly."

Renowned as FDR&#x2019;s favorite warship, the cruiser USS <i>Houston</i> was a prize target trapped in the far Pacific after Pearl Harbor. Without hope of reinforcement, her crew faced a superior Japanese force ruthlessly committed to total conquest. It wasn&#x2019;t a fair fight, but the men of the Houston would wage it to the death.<br><br> Hornfischer brings to life the awesome terror of nighttime naval battles that turned decks into strobe-lit slaughterhouses, the deadly rain of fire from Japanese bombers, and the almost superhuman effort of the crew as they miraculously escaped disaster again and again&#x2013;until their luck ran out during a daring action in Sunda Strait. There, hopelessly outnumbered, the <i>Houston</i> was finally sunk and its survivors taken prisoner. For more than three years their fate would be a mystery to families waiting at home.<br><br> In the brutal privation of jungle POW camps dubiously immortalized in such films as <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i>, the war continued for the men of the <i>Houston</i>&#x2014;a life-and-death struggle to survive forced labor, starvation, disease, and psychological torture. Here is the gritty, unvarnished story of the infamous Burma&#x2013;Thailand Death Railway glamorized by Hollywood, but which in reality mercilessly reduced men to little more than animals, who fought back against their dehumanization with dignity, ingenuity, sabotage, will&#x2013;power&#x2014;and the undying faith that their country would prevail.<br><br> Using journals and letters, rare historical documents, including testimony from postwar Japanese war crimes tribunals, and the eyewitness accounts of <i>Houston</i>&#x2019;s survivors, James Hornfischer has crafted an account of human valor so riveting and awe-inspiring, it&#x2019;s easy to forget that every single word is true.</p><p><b>James D. Hornfischer</b>&nbsp;is an award-winning naval historian.

A native of Massachusetts, he lives with his family in Austin, Texas.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Off the island of Bali, in the silhouette of mountains made sacred by the favor of local gods, a warship plied the black waters of an equatorial sea. The night of February 4, 1942, found her moving swiftly toward a port on the southern coast of the adjoining island of Java. She had sustained a deep wound that day, an aerial bomb striking her after turret, charring and melting the gun house and its entire stalk. The great blast killed forty-six men. Her captain now sought port to patch his ship and bury his dead with honors. For the flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, this was the first blow of a war not yet sixty days old.<br><br>The USS <i>Houston</i>, a heavy cruiser, was the largest combat vessel the U.S. Navy had committed to the Dutch East Indies. She was bound for the port of Tjilatjap. Its colliding consonants compelled American sailors to give the town the more symphonious nickname "Slapjack" or, chewing their words more bitterly, "that lousy dump." As the thunder of Japan's opening offensive washed over Indonesia in early 1942, Tjilatjap was one of three havens that Allied warships still maintained in these dangerous waters. With the enemy's invasion fleets pressing down from the north and his planes attacking from land bases ever closer to Java, those harbors were fast becoming untenable. The previous day, February 3, Japanese bombers struck Surabaya, the city in the island's east that was home to Adm. Thomas C. Hart's threadbare squadron of surface combatants. To the west, the port at Batavia (now Jakarta) was a marked target too. As Hart's commanders well knew, Japan's aviators had needed just forty-eight hours after the start of war on December 8 to smash American airpower in the Philippines, sink the two largest Allied warships in the region&#x2013;the British battleship <i>Prince of Wales</i> and the battlecruiser <i>Repulse</i>&#x2013;and land an invasion force on Luzon. The Imperial red tide knew no pause. Flowing southward, operating at high tempo by day and by night, the Japanese executed a leapfrogging series of amphibious invasions down the coasts of Borneo and Celebes, each gain consolidated and used to stage the next assault. The shadow of the Japanese offensive loomed over Java, where the Allies would make a last stand in defense of the old Dutch colonial outpost and aim to blunt Japan's onrushing advance toward Australia.<br><br>At midnight of February 3, alerted by Allied aircraft to the presence of a Japanese invasion fleet in Makassar Strait, north of Java, the <i>Houston</i> had departed Surabaya with a flotilla of U.S. and Dutch warships&#x2013;the aged light cruiser USS <i>Marblehead</i>, the Dutch light cruisers <i>De Ruyter</i> and <i>Tromp</i>, and an escort of eight destroyers. Under Dutch Rear Adm. Karel W. F. M. Doorman, the striking force steamed by night to avoid Japanese aircraft. But the distance to their target was such that the Allied ships had no choice but to cross the Flores Sea by daylight on February 4. No friendly fighter planes were on hand to cover them. It was about ten o'clock on that bright morning when Japanese bombers began appearing overhead, ending Doorman's mission before it ever really began.<br><br>That day had started as so many of them did, with the <i>Houston</i>'s Marine bugler putting his brass bell to the public address microphone and blowing the call to air defense. As men sprinted to their general quarters stations, they could look up and see the Japanese bombers droning by, one wave after the next, nine at a time, fifty-four in all, locked in tight V formations, silvery fuselages glinting in the sun. Nosing over into shallow power glides from seventeen thousand feet, the twin-engine G3M Nells began their bombing runs.<br><br>Capt. Albert Harold Rooks steered his ship through the maelstrom of splashes, some of the bombs landing close enough aboard to fracture rivets belowdecks, some falling in patterns dense enough to conceal the six-hundred-foot-long ship behind a temporary mountain range of foamy white seawater. Watching the <i>Houston</i> under bombardment, a sailor on another ship said, "All this water just sort of hung in the air. Then it started to fall back, and out from underneath all this stuff comes the <i>Houston</i> going thirty knots." A master ship handler, the fifty-year-old skipper had an intuitive sense of his cruiser's gait. He was expert in dodging the bombs that fluttered earthward in the midmorning sun, never hesitating to stretch the limits of the engineering plant or test the skill and endurance of the throttlemen and water tenders and machinists, who gamely kept pace with the sudden engine orders and speed changes, risking the destruction of their delicate machinery by the slightest misstep. Relying on the smart reactions of his snipes as an extension of his own hand, Rooks maneuvered his cruiser like none the crew had ever seen, accelerating and slowing, ordering "crashbacks" that wrenched his engines from full ahead straight into full astern, thus steering not only by rudder but by counterturning the propeller screws, the starboard pair surging ahead while the port pulled astern. "He handled that ship like you or I would handle a motorboat," said Howard R. Charles, a private in the <i>Houston</i>'s seventy-eight-man Marine detachment.<br><br>By acclamation Rooks was one of the brightest lights to wear four gold bars in the prewar U.S. Navy. He had been Admiral Hart's aide when the Asiatic Fleet boss was superintendent of the Naval Academy. On the teaching staff at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1940, Rooks showed a keen analytical mind, and it was with no evident sarcasm that colleagues called him the second coming of the great naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. In the few months since taking over the <i>Houston</i> in Manila, the quietly authoritative skipper had moved out of the shadow of a beloved predecessor and won, it seems, a reputation as a sort of minor deity.<br><br>An SOC Seagull floatplane was on the <i>Houston</i>'s catapult, propeller whipping the air at full throttle, its pilot ready for an explosive-charged launch. Under normal conditions in the days before radar, the SOCs were used for reconnaissance and gunnery spotting. Flung aloft from catapults mounted on the quarterdeck amidships, the biplanes would fly out ahead of the ship, climb to around two thousand feet, and spend two or three hours weaving back and forth on either side of the cruiser's base course heading. In combat, they could loiter over an enemy fleet, signaling corrections to the gunnery department. The Seagulls were light enough to grip the air at a speed as low as sixty miles per hour, permitting a leisurely reconnaissance pattern. But now the idea was to get the vulnerable, combustible planes off the ship before the Japanese got lucky with one of their bombs.<br><br>As another formation of bombers crossed overhead, the antiaircraft officer couldn't stand waiting for the SOC to get airborne. His five-inch guns, elevated high, roared. At once the muzzle blast, just ten feet from the plane, tore the canvas skin right off the plane. As Lt. Harold S. Hamlin recalled, "the pilot found himself sitting on a picked chicken&#x2013;the blast had removed every stitch of fabric from the plane. Pilot and crewman scrambled out, and the forlorn-looking plane, naked as a jay-bird, was jettisoned."<br><br>The <i>Houston</i> belched so much smoke from her after stack that the antiaircraft crews lost use of the aft rangefinder, bathed in black soot. So they aimed by eye. Good as the crews on her eight open-mount five-inch guns were, they were shocked to find that their ammunition was of little use. Their first salvo arced skyward right into the midst of the bombers. But only one of the four rounds was seen to explode. That sorry proportion held up through the day. Of the four hundred odd antiaircraft shells the <i>Houston</i>'s crews fired, nearly three hundred were duds. In the prewar years, the Navy Department, mindful of costs, had refused to let its ships fire live rounds in antiaircraft gunnery drills. The <i>Houston</i>'s gunnery officer had appealed time and again for permission to use live ammunition but was turned down. The projectiles thus saved had been left to sit and age in the magazines. Now, as the realization dawned on them that most of their stored projectiles were little more than outsize paperweights, the antiaircraft crews became "mad as scalded dogs" and fired all the faster, if to little result.<br><br>During the bombardment that rained down on them that morning, the light cruiser <i>Marblehead</i> was straddled perfectly by a stick of seven bombs, engulfing the old ship in giant splashes. Two struck home, and a near miss, detonating underwater close aboard to port, did as much damage as the direct hits. Fifteen men were killed as fires raged fore and aft. With part of her hull dished in, scooping in seawater at high pressure, seams and rivets leaking, the <i>Marblehead</i> listed to starboard, settling by the head, her rudder jammed into a hard port turn. Seeing her distress, Captain Rooks turned the <i>Houston</i> toward her to bring his gunners to bear on the attackers. As he did so, another V of bombers passed overhead at fifteen thousand feet. A second flock of bombs wobbled earthward. They missed&#x2013;all of them except for the stray.<br><br>Some say that the lone five-hundred-pounder must have gotten hung up in the Japanese plane's bomb bay on release. With its carefully calculated trajectory interrupted, it wandered from the path of its explosive peers, arcing down outside the field of view from the pilothouse, where Rooks, head tilted skyward, binoculars in hands, was watching the flight of ordnance and conning his ship to avoid it. Unseen until it was far too late, the wayward bomb found the ship. It punched through the searchlight platform mounted midway up the <i>Houston</i>'s sixty-foot-high mainmast, rattled down through its great steel tripod, and struck just forward of the aft eight-inch gun mount, whose triple barrels were trained to port, locked and loaded to fend off low-flying planes.<br><br>The bomb's blast reverberated all along the <i>Houston</i>'s length, and up and down its seven levels of decks. The sickened crew felt the cruiser lift, rock, and reel. When fires ignited the silk-encased powder bags stored in the number-three hoist, a vicious flash fire engulfed the gun chamber and reached down into the powder circle. Yellow-white smoke washed over the fantail.<br><br>Intense heat inside the heavily perforated gun house, or perhaps a firing circuit shorted out in the deluge from the fire hoses, caused the center eight-inch rifle to discharge. The untimely blast startled the crew, and they collided with one another diving for cover. The powder-fed storm of flames took nearly four dozen of Captain Rooks's best men. They never stood a chance, not the doomed crew inside Turret Three, nor the men in the powder circle and handling room below them, nor the after repair party, cut down nearly to a man at their general quarters station, right under the hole in the main deck. In nearby crew's quarters, men were found blown straight through the springs of their bunks. Scraps of clothing stuck in the springs were all that remained of them, identification made possible only by the stenciling on their shirts. They could not have known what hit them. But far worse was in store for everyone aft should the flames reach the eight-inch powder bags piled in the magazine.<br><br>Fearing a catastrophic explosion, Cdr. Arthur L. Maher, the <i>Houston</i>'s gunnery officer, rallied the firefighting crews and sent two petty officers into the scorched ruin of the gun mount searching for survivors. One of them, aviation machinist's mate second class John W. Ranger, played a hose on the other, Charles Fowler, to keep him cool. Then Ranger joined Fowler inside, armed with a carbon dioxide canister to fight the flames, the heat from which was already bubbling grease smeared on the eight-inch projectiles kept in ready storage.<br><br>By the light of a battle lantern in the turret's lower chambers, gunner's mate second class Czeslaus Kunke and seaman second class Jack D. Smith dogged down the metal flaps that separated the magazine from the burning handling room and flooded the magazine and powder hoist. "I told John [Ranger] if we had not stopped the fire before it arrived at the magazine he would have been the first Navy astronaut," Smith wrote. Their quick thinking and a measure of good fortune saved the ship from a final calamity.<br><br>With the <i>Houston</i>'s main battery hobbled and the <i>Marblehead</i> damaged, Admiral Doorman aborted the mission, ordering the wounded cruisers to Tjilatjap for repair. As evening fell, Captain Rooks steered his bruised ship toward safety, out of the Flores Sea through Alas Strait, then west into the easternmost littorals of the Indian Ocean. Steaming in the shadows of the holy peaks of Lombok and Bali, the <i>Houston</i>'s crew gathered their dead shipmates on the fantail. The <i>Houston</i>'s two medical officers, Cdr. William A. Epstein and Lt. Clement D. Burroughs, exhausted themselves patching up the wounded and easing the worst of them into death. "I'm convinced they were never the same again," wrote Marine 2nd Lt. Miles Barrett. "For weeks their nerves were completely shattered." An ensign named John B. Nelson had the chore of identifying the charred corpses as they lay in makeshift state. Nelson's eyes filled with tears as he studied the remains, identifying some and guessing at others. Then they were covered with a canvas tarpaulin to await burial. A carpenter's mate oversaw the crew detailed to assemble caskets from scrap lumber. Their hammers tapped and tapped, marking time through the night. "War came to us in a real way. It knocked all the cockiness out of us," said Sgt. Charley L. Pryor Jr. of the ship's Marine detachment. "We saw what war could be in its real fury, just in those brief few moments."<br><br>A ceremonial watch was set in honor of the dead. Seaman first class John Bartz, a stout Minnesotan from the Second Division, held his rifle at attention on the midwatch, fidgeting in the starlit darkness. What unsettled him was not so much the corpses but their unexpected movements at sudden intervals: arms and legs twitching, rising and reaching in death's stiffening grip.<br><br>"I'm telling you, it was spooky," Bartz said. "It was really scary when you're standing there, a young kid about eighteen years old. I was glad to see my relief at four."</p><h2>Saxon Math 7/6: Homeschool Set/Box</h2><p>Saxon math programs produce confident students who are not only able to correctly compute, but also to apply concepts to new situations. These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called &#34;incremental development and continual review.&#34; Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar.

He was murdered. </p><p>That was the first thought twenty-eight-year-old Mariah Lyons had as she awoke from a fitful sleep in the home where she had been raised in Mahwah, a town bordering the Ramapo Mountains in northern New Jersey. Brushing back the tears that were welling in her eyes, she sat up slowly, slid her feet onto the floor, and looked around her room. </p><p>When she was sixteen, she had been allowed to redecorate it as a birthday present and had chosen to have the walls painted red. For the coverlet and pillows and valances she had decided on a cheery red-and-white flowered pattern. The big, comfortable chair in the corner was where she always did her homework, instead of at the desk. Her eyes fell upon the shelf that her father had built over the dresser to hold her trophies from her high school soccer and basketball championship teams. He was so proud of me, she thought sadly. He wanted to redecorate again when I finished college, but I never wanted it changed. I don&#x2019;t care if it still has the look of a teenager&#x2019;s room. </p><p>She tried to remind herself that until now she had been one of those fortunate people whose only experience with death in the family had been when she was fifteen and her eighty-six-year-old grandmother had passed away in her sleep. I really loved Gran, but I was so grateful that she had been spared a lot of indignity, she thought. Her strength was failing and she hated to be dependent on anyone. </p><p>Mariah stood up, reached for the robe at the foot of the bed, and slipped into it, tying the sash around her slender waist. But this is different, she thought. My father did not die a natural death. He was shot while he was reading at his desk in his study downstairs. Her mouth went dry as she asked herself again the same questions she had been asking over and over. Was Mom in the room when it happened? Or did she come in after she heard the sound of the shot? And is there any chance that Mom was the one who did it? Please, God, don&#x2019;t let it turn out to be that way. </p><p>She walked over to the vanity and looked into the mirror. I look so pale, she thought as she brushed back her shoulder-length black hair. Her eyes were swollen from all the tears of the last few days. An incongruous thought went through her mind: I&#x2019;m glad I have Daddy&#x2019;s dark blue eyes. I&#x2019;m glad I&#x2019;m tall like him. It sure helped when I was playing basketball. </p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe he is gone,&#x201d; she whispered, recalling his seventieth birthday party only three weeks earlier. The events of the past four days replayed in her mind. On Monday evening she had stayed at her office to work out an investment plan for a new client. When she got home to her Greenwich Village apartment at eight o&#x2019;clock, she had made her usual evening call to her father. Daddy sounded very down, she remembered. He told me that Mom had had a terrible day, that it was clear the Alzheimer&#x2019;s was getting worse. Something made me phone back at ten thirty. I was worried about both of them. </p><p>When Daddy didn&#x2019;t answer, I knew that something was wrong. Mariah thought back to that seemingly endless drive from Greenwich Village as she had rushed to New Jersey that night. I called them again and again on the way over, she thought. She remembered how she had turned into the driveway at eleven twenty, fumbling for her house key in the dark as she ran from the car. All the downstairs lights were still on in the house, and once she was inside, she went straight to the study. </p><p>The horror of what she had found replayed in her mind as it had been doing incessantly. Her father was slumped across his desk, his head and shoulders bloodied. Her mother, soaked in blood, was cowering in the closet near the desk, clutching her father&#x2019;s pistol. </p><p>Mom saw me and started moaning, &#x201c;So much noise... so much blood... &#x201d; </p><p>I was frantic, Mariah remembered. When I called 911, all I could scream was &#x201c;My father is dead! My father has been shot!&#x201d; </p><p>The police arrived in minutes. I&#x2019;ll never forget how they looked at Mom and me. I had hugged Daddy, so I had blood all over me too. I overheard one of the cops say that by touching Daddy I had contaminated the crime scene. </p><p>Mariah realized she had been staring unseeingly into the mirror. Glancing down at the clock on the vanity she saw that it was already seven thirty. I have to get ready, she thought. We should be at the funeral parlor by nine. I hope Rory is getting Mom ready by now. Rory Steiger, a stocky sixty-two-year-old woman, had been her mother&#x2019;s caregiver for the past two years. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, showered and her hair blown dry, Mariah came back into the bedroom, opened the door of the closet, and took out the black-and-white jacket and black skirt she had chosen to wear to the funeral. People used to be draped in black when there was a death in the family, she thought. I remember seeing pictures of Jackie Kennedy in a long mourning veil. Oh God, why did this have to happen? </p><p>When she was finished dressing, she walked over to the window. She had left it open when she had gone to bed and the breeze was making the curtains ripple on the sill. She stood for a moment looking out over the backyard, which was shaded by the Japanese maple trees her father had planted years ago. The begonias and impatiens he had planted in the spring ringed the patio. The sun made the Ramapo Mountains in the distance shimmer with tones of green and gold. It was a perfect late August day. </p><p>I don&#x2019;t want it to be a beautiful day, Mariah thought. It&#x2019;s as if nothing terrible has happened. But it <i>has</i> happened. Daddy was murdered. I want it to be rainy and cold and wet. I want the rain to weep on his casket. I want the heavens to weep for him. </p><p>He is gone forever. </p><p>Guilt and sadness enveloped her. That gentle college professor who was so glad to retire three years ago and spend most of his time studying ancient manuscripts had been violently murdered. I loved him dearly, but it&#x2019;s so awful that for the last year and a half our relationship has been strained, all because of his affair with Lillian Stewart, the professor he met from Columbia University, whose very existence had changed all of our lives. </p><p>Mariah remembered her dismay when she came home a year and a half ago to find her mother holding pictures she had found of Lillian and her father with their arms around each other. I was so angry when I realized that this had probably been going on while Lily was with him on his archaeological digs to Egypt or Greece or Israel or God knows where, for the past five years. I was so furious that he actually had her in the house when we had his other friends, like Richard, Charles, Albert, and Greg, over for dinner. </p><p>I despise that woman, Mariah told herself. </p><p>The fact that my father was twenty years her senior apparently did not bother Lily, Mariah thought grimly. I&#x2019;ve tried to be fair and understand. </p><p>Mom has been drifting away for years, and I know it was so tough on Dad to see her deteriorate. But she still has her somewhat good days. She still talks about those pictures so often. She was so hurt knowing that Dad had someone else in his life. </p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to be thinking like this, Mariah said to herself as she turned away from the window. I want my father to be alive. I want to tell him how sorry I am that I asked him only last week if Lily of the Nile Valley had been a good traveling companion on their latest jaunt to Greece. </p><p>Turning away from the window, she walked over to the desk and studied a picture of her mother and father taken ten years ago. I remember how loving they used to be with each other, Mariah thought. They were married when they were in graduate school. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t make my appearance for fifteen years. </p><p>She smiled faintly as she remembered her mother telling her that as long as they had had to wait, God had given them the perfect child. Actually, Mom was being more than generous, she thought. Both of them were so strikingly handsome. And elegant. And charming. Growing up I certainly was no head-turner. A mop of long, straight black hair, so skinny that l looked undernourished, beanpole tall, and teeth that I grew into but were too big for my face when they first arrived. But I was lucky enough to end up being a decent composite of both of them. </p><p>Dad, Daddy, please don&#x2019;t be dead. Be at the breakfast table when I get there. Have your coffee cup in hand, and be reading the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i> I&#x2019;ll grab the <i>Post</i> and turn to &#x201c;Page Six,&#x201d; and you&#x2019;ll look over your glasses and give me that look that means a mind is a dreadful thing to waste. </p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to eat anything, I&#x2019;ll just have coffee, Mariah decided as she opened the door of the bedroom and walked down the hall to the staircase. She paused on the top step but didn&#x2019;t hear any sound from the connecting bedrooms where her mother and Rory slept. I hope that means they&#x2019;re downstairs, she thought. </p><p>There was no sign of them in the breakfast room. She went into the kitchen. Betty Pierce, the housekeeper, was there. &#x201c;Mariah, your mother wouldn&#x2019;t eat anything. She wanted to go into the study. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll like what she&#x2019;s wearing but she&#x2019;s pretty insistent. It&#x2019;s that blue and green linen suit you bought her for Mother&#x2019;s Day.&#x201d; </p><p>Mariah considered protesting but then asked herself, What in the name of God is the difference? She took the coffee that Betty poured for her and carried it into the study. Rory was standing there looking distressed. At Mariah&#x2019;s unasked question she jerked her head toward the closet door. &#x201c;She won&#x2019;t let me leave the door open,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She won&#x2019;t let me stay in there with her.&#x201d; </p><p>Mariah tapped on the closet door and opened it slowly while murmuring her mother&#x2019;s name.

Although the suggestions are fine (&#x201c;I turn off the faucet while I brush my teeth&#x201d;) the reasons behind the actions (&#x201c;because I love the fish&#x201d;) could use more explanation for such a young audience. The strong appeal comes from the simple artwork done in Parr&#x2019;s signature style, which features pure colors, objects and people outlined in thick black ink, and kids whose round faces are comprised of two dots for eyes and upturned lines for mouths. Young children will get a kick out of the vivid art (and the funny touches, like a fish wearing glasses); feel helpful when they do things like write on both sides of the paper; and perhaps intuit why protecting the environment is a good thing, if not exactly making the connection between saving paper and saving trees.

To locate it, he goes to the palace of the All-Seeing Crone, Baba Uranai, who can find anything in the world...for a price! The crone agrees to find the Dragon Ball for free if Goku and his friends--Yamcha, Pu&#39;ar, Kuririn and Upa--can best her five supernatural champions in one-on-one combat. but even if they can beat Dracula, the Mummy, and the Devil, the final challenger just might give Goku the shock of his life!</p><p>Akira Toriyama&#39;s first weekly series, Dr. Slump, has entertained generations of readers in Japan since it was introduced in Shueisha&#39;s Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 1980. A few years later, he created his wildly popular Dragon Ball series, which brought him international success.

Who will find him? Will it be Giraffe, who himself seems to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or Cow, or perhaps even the author herself? </p><p>One thing's for sure--it probably won't be Duck. Duck doesn't seem concerned that Bear is missing. In fact, he seems to be trying to steal the show for himself! Duck would much prefer that the reader pick up his own book, <i>The Duck Who Showed Up</i>. He even disguises himself as Bear in an attempt to fool the reader. But after pages and pages of Duck's antics and search-party chaos, Bear appears somewhere utterly unexpected. In fact, it looks like someone may have tried to get rid of him on purpose....</p><p>LeUyen Pham's <i>The Bear Who Wasn't There </i>takes readers a hilarious search for the missing title character.</p></p><p><b>LeUyen Pham</b> worked in animation before turning to children's books, and has illustrated numerous other picture books in addition to <i>The Bear Who Wasn't There</i>. She lives and works in San Francisco, California, with her husband and her two adorable sons, Leo and Adrian.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;The author/illustrator draws inspiration from the one thing that has been missing from all of her previous work: a bear. All parts of the book, from the case cover to the inside front and back covers to the title page, make light of the absence of the bear. The text is metafictional, calling attention to itself and even bringing Pham in as a character late in the tale. Much of the narrative is told through dialogue in which a cast of animal characters provide information about the bear's whereabouts and suggestions for where to find it. Anticipation builds with each page turn and every new animal who appears. The large cast includes aliens, armadillos, koalas, sloths, dinosaurs, zebras, and more. The author speaks directly to readers in a tone that is fun and light. The mixed-media art supports the humor by depicting cartoon animals who have exaggerated features and exhibit many human actions, such as standing on two legs, drinking out of a straw, using a toilet and a bathtub, and performing acts of magic, while the search for the bear takes place. The ending offers readers the payoff they were waiting for. VERDICT This witty picture book is perfect for storytime.&#x2014;Samantha Lumetta, Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OH</p><h2>The New Rules of Work: The Muse Playbook for Navigating the Modern Workplace</h2><p><b>The world of work has changed. </b><br><br>People in previous generations tended to pick one professional path and stick to it.

If, for example, you were an English major in college, you would go into book or magazine publishing, journalism, or teaching, or apply to law school. If you were an econ major, you more than likely planned on a job in finance. End of story.<br><br>The new rule: Your education taught you skills and gave you experiences that brought you to where you are today&#x2014;but now your past is a platform to spring forward from, not a ball and chain. Plus, your career path can be plotted from not only your education, but also your strengths, innate talents, personal interests, and core values. Maybe you&#x2019;ll use the communication skills you picked up as an English major, your attention to detail, and your love for creativity and design to land a job in event planning. Or social media and community management. Or as a museum curator. The choice is yours.<br><br>The Keys to Your Kingdom<br><br>In the old world of work, the decisions you made at age seventeen or eighteen years old&#x2014;like choosing a college and a major&#x2014;dictated not only your first job but likely your entire career path (just think about how crazy that is!). Moreover, the trajectory of that path was assumed to be linear: that as time passed, you would naturally get promoted, sometimes move between companies, and eventually reach a high position from which you would someday retire. You probably followed that path blindly; since it so clearly dictated your direction, you didn&#x2019;t need to stop and think about what you wanted. As a result, there were few opportunities to change or adjust course based on your unique values, skills, and aspirations. Like in kindergarten, you were assigned a seat, and you were required to sit there for the rest of the year.<br><br>It seems pretty clear that that concept of a predetermined career path has outlived its relevance. Some years ago, it was briefly challenged by an overly expansive (and somewhat ungrounded) &#x201c;follow your star&#x201d; approach, where people were advised to &#x201c;live their dreams and the money will follow.&#x201d; There was a sense that instead of a rigid, cookie-cutter plan, you didn&#x2019;t need any plan; that over time, as you moved from job to job, you would gain more and more self-knowledge, culminating in steady promotions and raises, and one day, the holy grail: comfortable retirement.<br><br>If only that always worked out.<br><br>The New Rules ask us to answer alternate questions that stem from a radically different point of view. Instead of assuming the path is preordained or that it will appear miraculously by simply wanting it to do so, we need to understand&#x2014;and accept&#x2014;that we are in charge of our own path. No major, no degree, no parental connections, no industry, company, or proverbial north star is going to determine or decide where we are going. It&#x2019;s up to us to choose the destination that is right for us and then design the path that will make it happen. Unlike in kindergarten, if we don&#x2019;t like the seat we&#x2019;ve been assigned, we can get up and move to another. In fact, we can even pick up and switch to a new classroom or school altogether. We&#x2019;re in charge of ourselves.<br><br>And this is great: What freedom! What possibility! What self-empowerment! But we also know that with all of this potential for great success and happiness comes something else: What terror! What pressure! What stress! What if we make a mistake? A wrong move, a poor choice, a stupid decision? We&#x2019;ll be destined to wallow in a career we hate forever, right?<br><br>Wrong. Because here&#x2019;s another great thing about the New Rules: we live in a culture where the world of work will continue to change rapidly. That&#x2019;s why we think of career planning as a series of two-to-five-year steps, to make thoughtfully and one at a time. So you are here now, trying to figure out your path for just the next two to five years. Not for the rest of your life. Sure, if you have long-term plans, we will help you tailor your Now Plan to your Big Plan, but in general, the advice in this book is going to be focused on that two-to-five-year horizon; on getting you ready to make the most of what you are doing today and for the next few years. The best part is, you can return to it again and again&#x2014;the practices and thought exercises we&#x2019;re doing here will serve you not only now, but next time you&#x2019;re ready for another step, shift, or reinvention in your career.<br><br>Who Are You Now?<br><br>Of course, it&#x2019;s hard to shake off the urge to try to determine your life as soon as you graduate from college. We get it, because we&#x2019;ve been there. Take Kathryn, for example. After majoring in international relations and French, she always dreamed that she would end up in foreign service or become a diplomat. Her interest in travel, her love of languages, and her natural inclination to jump in and solve problems seemed to fit exactly with the career she had imagined for herself. Yet a few weeks into what had seemed like a dream position working at the US embassy in Cyprus, Kathryn felt that interest wane. The problems her team was tackling were important, but solutions moved the needle by inches and progress could sometimes take years, requiring unbelievable patience. When colleagues noticed her penchant for offering to roll up her sleeves and get to work right away, they would laugh and suggest she consider a different field where she could make an impact more quickly. Kathryn&#x2019;s expectations ran smack into the realities of working in the foreign service, and she suddenly realized it might not be such a solid long-term fit after all.<br><br>It was as if a tether to her mental image of career satisfaction had been severed and she was totally adrift. &#x201c;It was incredibly frustrating,&#x201d; she remembers. &#x201c;I thought I had it all figured out, and suddenly I realized that I didn&#x2019;t know what I was doing for the next year, let alone for the rest of my life. I&#x2019;d invested so much in a career path I was about to walk away from. It&#x2019;s funny to look back and remember how much I was worried I&#x2019;d &#x2018;wasted&#x2019; that time. But now I realize that those years were anything but. They were useful&#x2014;time to test myself&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;d be where I am today without them.&#x201d;<br><br>Alex had a similar experience. Growing up in France, a country where your high school choices still guide much of your career opportunity, she was forced to pick a direction at the age of fifteen. Between the sciences, literature, and economics, she picked the sciences. She was good at them, and they were valued highly in the French education system. Two years later, she again had to choose, this time between math, physics, and biology for her senior-year specialization. Alex chose biology and started learning about genetics by mating strains of fruit flies. She applied to college in the United States and moved across the Atlantic to start her studies, where she declared a major of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology (a fancy term for genetics). But after many long hours spent toiling in the lab her freshman year, Alex realized that as much as she loved learning about genetics, she didn&#x2019;t enjoy the day-to-day lab work that would be a big part of her job if she continued down this road. Genetics was an interest, yes, but not the right career for her. Facing this fact was hard, but it was also a pivotal moment that forced Alex to question her assumptions and embark on a journey of exploration and learning that brought her to the consulting company where she met Kathryn. Without these two diverging paths and the twists and turns we took, The Muse might never have come to be.<br><br>The point is: often what we think we want in our heads is actually very different from what we can learn we want in the day-to-day experience of actually living our careers. So even if you think you have your dream career all figured out, it&#x2019;s really important to go through the steps outlined in the next few chapters. The goal is to dig deep enough to have a clear understanding of what kind of job or career will make you truly happy.<br><br>What&#x2019;s different about today&#x2019;s rules is that they are all premised on your having a much keener, more concrete, and more nuanced understanding of your values, interests, and motivations. This requires not only understanding what you enjoy and what you&#x2019;re good at, but also how these interests and skills stack up against other important personal priorities. How much money do you need to live comfortably? How much flexibility do you want in your weekly schedule? How important is your job title, the name of your company, the size of your office? What kind of impact do you want to have on the world? We&#x2019;re going to help you zero in on all of these variables so that you can not only succeed at defining your path, but enjoy getting to know yourself a bit better in the process!<br><br>Knowing yourself in this way is a huge part of finding the right job, by which we mean, the right job for you, right now. So in this chapter we&#x2019;ll address the first of what we call the Three R&#x2019;s: Reflect. And by the time you complete the exercises and steps in this chapter, you will feel much more confident in your understanding of what you are looking for in a career or job. Even if you have absolutely no idea what you want to do with your life, these tools can help point you in the right direction. Of course, if you&#x2019;ve picked up this book already knowing who you are and what kind of job you are looking for, that&#x2019;s fine, too. You will still benefit from the exercises, as the reflection will only serve to underscore your confidence and sharpen your drive. Wherever you are, we&#x2019;re here to take you forward.<br><br>It&#x2019;s time to develop a special kind of self-awareness: you are going to come to know yourself in an introspective yet objective way. We are big believers in looking inward before you can expect to create the outward success you aspire to.<br><br>To start figuring out what you want in a job or in life, it helps to start by reflecting on who you are today. One of the early steps of this process is being brutally honest with how you are feeling (frazzled and fearful, confident and competent, muddled but also excited?) and where you are (in a current job that you despise, in a current job that&#x2019;s fine but not quite right, out of a job, living with your parents and unable to pay rent on your own place, in between a rock and a hard place?). You&#x2019;re going to ask yourself a couple of hard questions, but trust us, it&#x2019;ll be worth it.<br><br>Question 1: What Do You Value?<br><br>Back in the 1970s, a few social scientists came up with a way for people to deepen their understanding of themselves by &#x201c;clarifying their values.&#x201d; You can probably hear a bit of that seventies vibe in the language alone. But they were onto something: clarifying our values really helps when we are trying to figure out what we want in our lives.<br><br>In the context of creating a successful career plan, the word values refers to what in your work provides you with meaning and purpose. That might be a deep sense of creativity, or it might be making a positive contribution to society. In many ways, your values are more important than the type of work you&#x2019;re actually doing; in fact, numerous studies have shown that most people who pursue work that aligns with their values feel more satisfied and successful in their careers.<br><br>When it comes to charting a professional path, clarifying our own values can feel confusing. There are so many outside voices and perspectives that can clutter this very personal process: parents&#x2019; expectations and advice, friends&#x2019; choices, society&#x2019;s collective ideas about the &#x201c;right&#x201d; path. It&#x2019;s time to shut all those out. Remember, we&#x2019;re talking about your life&#x2014;and your values&#x2014;not your well-meaning mom&#x2019;s or dad&#x2019;s, not your favorite professor&#x2019;s, not your brilliant roommate&#x2019;s.

D. Robb.<br></b>&nbsp;<br>Once upon a time, in a world far removed from the days when fairy tales were new, five bestselling authors spin versions that take the classic stories into a new dimension. You&#x2019;ll recognize Hansel and Gretel, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and other enduring characters, but they&#x2019;ll exist in realms beyond your imagination, where the familiar is transformed into the extraordinary and otherworldly.&nbsp;<br><br>Find happily ever after with...<br><br><b>MIRROR, MIRROR</b></p><p><b>J. D. Robb </b>is the pseudonym for a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than 200 novels, including the bestselling In Death series. There are more than 500 million copies of her books in print.Returning novella contributors Robb, Blayney, McComas, and Ryan (The Unquiet) are joined by newcomer Fox in this interesting collection of fairy-tale&#x2013;inspired stories of romance and intrigue. Robb's Eve Dallas must track down a pair of missing twins in a Hansel and Gretel police procedural, Taken in Death. Blayney's wish-granting coin entwines a pair of lonely adventure seekers in romance beyond their lives as a servant and a sergeant in her charming 1816 fantasy, If Wishes Were Horses, which gives a nod to Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Fox introduces a charming ghostly television reporter to the woman who buys his haunted house in Beauty, Sleeping, a clever, turned-on-its-head version of Sleeping Beauty. McComas's phenomenal modern retelling of The Little Match Girl gives a too-generous activist and the cop who thinks he's too old for her a chance at love in The Christmas Comet. In Ryan's Cinderella tale, Stroke of Midnight, a teacher travels to her father's hometown in Ireland, falls in love, and nearly lets her wicked stepmother ruin everything before an improbable conclusion. Though varying dramatically in approaches to the theme, each novella successfully captures the spirit of magic and happy endings.

A true Renaissance man, the opera singer, banjo player, and passionate amateur baker worked his way up, eventually becoming head bread baker. But Philip is not just a talented craftsman; he is a bread shaman. Being a baker isn&#x2019;t just mastering the chemistry of flour, salt, water, and yeast; it is being an alchemist&#x2014;perfecting the transformation of simple ingredients into an elegant expression of the soul.</p><p><em>Breaking Bread</em> is an intimate tour of Philip&#x2019;s kitchen, mind, and heart. Through seventy-five original recipes and life stories told with incandescent prose, he shares not only the secrets to creating loaves of unparalleled beauty and flavor but the secrets to a good life. From the butter biscuits, pecan pie, and whiskey bread pudding of his childhood in the Ozarks to French baguettes and focaccias, bagels and muffins, cinnamon buns and ginger scones, <em>Breaking Bread</em> is a guide to wholeheartedly embracing the staff of life.</p><p>Philip gently guides novice bakers and offers recipes and techniques for the most advanced levels. He also includes a substantial technical section covering the bread-making process, tools, and ingredients. As he illuminates an artisan&#x2019;s odyssey and a life lived passionately, he reveals how the act of baking offers spiritual connection to our pasts, our families, our culture and communities, and, ultimately, ourselves. Exquisite, sensuous, and delectable, <em>Breaking Bread</em> inspires us to take risks, make bolder choices, live more fully, and bake bread and break it with those we love.</p></p><p>&#x201c;I have immense respect for Martin Philip who left his life of certainty and corporate work in the city for the countryside of Vermont to apprentice at King Arthur Flour. <em>Breaking Bread </em>is an exceptional story of how the perfect amount of dedication and craftsmanship yields a delicious journey and a thoughtful return to one&#x2019;s roots. Martin worked his way up to become the company&#x2019;s lead baker, proving that everyone can start from scratch and succeed.&#x201d; (Mario Batali, chef, author, philanthropist)<br><br>&#x201c;I met Martin Philip years ago, when&#x2014;at my son&#x2019;s voice lesson&#x2014;he handed me a steaming, fragrant loaf of bread to take home.&nbsp; Years later, when I was doing research for a novel and needed to learn about making bread, I turned to him for a private tutorial.&nbsp; <strong>But</strong> <strong>in addition to being an excellent baker, Martin is also an excellent writer.&nbsp; <em>Breaking Bread</em> is truly a feast &#x2014;a history of bread itself, cleverly hidden within the story of a man who fell in love with baking.</strong>&nbsp; With verbal descriptions that burst on the tongue and recipes that your hands itch to try, <strong>this beautiful book is food for the soul.</strong>&#x201d; (<strong>Jodi Picoult, </strong><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Small Great Things</em><strong></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;From bagels and biscuits, brioche and baguettes (as well as pies and pancakes) these recipes from master baker Martin Philip, accompanied by his inspiring story, makes me want to pack up everything and follow in his footsteps. For those of us who can&#x2019;t do that (yet!), baking our way through <em>Breaking Bread</em> is the next best thing.&#x201d; (<strong> David Lebovitz, author of <em>L&#x2019;Appart</em> and <em>My Paris Kitchen </em></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;Martin appears in <em>Breaking Bread</em><strong> </strong>just as he does to his good friends:&nbsp; consummate baker, a stickler at times as he demands too much of himself the way so many artists do, but just like his recipes, wonderfully generous and understanding to his colleagues and students.&#x201d; (James MacGuire, chef and instructor, translator of <em>Le Go�t du Pain</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Martin Philip&#x2019;s work in <em>Breaking Bread</em> is tactile and honest.&nbsp; This is a thinking man&#x2019;s perspective on the art and the philosophy of why we bake.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s in his blood and now he&#x2019;s sharing it with the world.&nbsp; The recipes are sound; the storytelling - evocative; the pictures - illustrative, beautiful.&nbsp; You&#x2019;ll be inspired to knead some dough, crank up your oven, and get some flour on your hands. <em>Breaking Bread </em>is a reason to bake again.&#x201d; (Steven Satterfield, James Beard Foundation Best Chef Southeast 2017, author of <em>Root to Leaf</em>)</p><h2>Handbook for Healing</h2><p><b>Can God really use me?</b><br> Amazement!

Those commitments are the bedrock of her recovery and her work helping other young people dealing with the issues she lives with every single day. </p><p>Demi is a platinum-selling recording artist whose latest album&#x2015;DEMI&#x2015;is already a smash hit. She's about to embark on her second season as a judge on X-Factor, and just launched The Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program. And she is an outspoken advocate for young people everywhere. </p><p>Demi is also a young woman finding her way in the world. She has dealt deftly with her struggles in the face of public scrutiny, and she has always relied, not just on friends and family, but daily affirmations of her self-worth and value. Affirmations that steady her days and strengthen her resolve. </p><p>Those affirmations have grown into STAYING STRONG, a powerful 365-day collection of Demi's most powerful, honest, and hopeful insights. Each day will provide the readers with a quote, a personal reflection and a goal. </p><p>These are Demi's words. Words she lives by and shares with the people she loves and total strangers alike. They are a powerful testament to a young woman standing up and fighting back.</p></p><p><p><b>From the Book: A Letter from Demi Lovato</b></p> <p>Dear Reader,</p> <p>I have been through all kinds of experiences in my life, and I have faced struggles ranging from addiction to depression, all the while on a search for self-discovery and happiness. There are always going to be highs and lows, heartbreaks and victories, and everything in between. So sometimes the smallest few words can make all the difference; they can comfort and they can inspire.</p> <p>Each day I meditate and pray by getting in touch with the higher power within me. No matter how old you are, where you come from, your race or religion, it is vital to have a higher power--something bigger than yourself that you can turn to for comfort.

Stay strong, be brave, love hard and true, and you will have nothing to lose.</p> <p>All my love, </p> <p>Demi</p> <p><b>An Introduction from Katie Couric</b></p> <p>I first met Demi over breakfast at the London Hotel in the summer of 2012. Her career was on fire. She had a huge hit in "Skyscraper," "Give Your Heart a Break" was climbing the charts (it would eventually hit #1), and she was months away from being named a judge on The X Factor alongside Simon Cowell and Britney Spears.</p> <p>For a girl who had just turned 20 and made her name as a Disney teen queen, she seemed wise beyond her years. But she encountered more than a few bumps on her road to success. Demi shared her personal struggles with me, including her battles with anorexia and bulimia, bullying, self-harm and bipolar disorder, and how these challenges almost derailed her career.</p> <p>As a mother of two daughters, I was so grateful that Demi was using her painful experiences to talk frankly to girls and let them know that fame doesn't necessarily shield you from insecurity and self-doubt. By pulling back the glossy curtain of celebrity and exposing her all-too-human side, I know Demi made countless young women with some of those same problems feel much less alone.</p> <p>Not long after our first meeting, I welcomed Demi to the set of my daytime talk show. No surprise, she was charismatic and generous. Her willingness to speak so openly in a public forum inspired me to share my own experience with an eating disorder in my twenties, something that I had never spoken about before. Demi's honesty made me feel safe to be honest about my own past.</p> <p>Demi has a unique relationship with her fans. They love her and she loves them right back. She's taught us all that we need to give our hearts a break at the low moments, and take the time to enjoy the view from the skyscraper when we hit our highs.</p> <p>Whether you're 16, or, in my case, 56, you'll learn something from Demi's journey and life advice, and end up loving her even more.</p><p>Twenty-one-year-old Demi Lovato's fame began when she was cast on<i> Barney and Friends</i>. From the outside, she was all smiles, but as she grew up in front of the camera&#x2015;the star of the record-breaking <i>Camp Rock</i> franchise; leading lady of her own Disney show, <i>Sonny with a Chance</i>; and a budding music career&#x2015;she was falling apart. As Demi entered adolescence, she was being bullied, and she struggled with bulimia, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, and eventually secretly began cutting herself. </p><p>Her career was taking off, but she bowed out of her world-wide tour and checked herself into rehab, which she successfully completed. She started the Lovato Treatment Scholarship program to help others with their illnesses. </p><p>She's currently entering her second season as an X-Factor judge and her latest album <i>Demi</i> has gone platinum. She will also be joining the fifth season of Glee. Demi has many accolades, including one MTV Video Music Award, twenty-five Teen Choice Awards nominations, 14 of which she has won, four People's Choice Awards, one ALMA award, a Billboard Touring Award and several others. </p><p>Outside of her work in the entertainment industry, Lovato is involved in philanthropic activity through charity work and various social and environmental causes.

Mamaw tightened the soft cashmere throw around her thin shoulders. Slivers of light pierced the velvety blackness over the Cove, and pewter-colored shadows danced on the spiky marsh grass like ethereal ghosts.<br> <br>Mamaw sat huddled on an oversize, black wicker chair on her back porch, her legs tucked beneath her. The fog was moist on her face and the predawn chill seemed to penetrate straight to her bones. She couldn&#x2019;t seem to get warm with Lucille gone. Since her dear friend&#x2019;s death, many nights she&#x2019;d awakened from a fitful sleep and come outdoors hoping the fresh air would settle her. She&#x2019;d found scant warmth or peace in the chill of predawn. In the distance, the Atlantic Ocean, her mercurial friend, roared like a hungry beast. The waves were devouring the dunes in a relentless rhythm. Echoes reverberated over Sullivan&#x2019;s Island.<br> <br>Over a week had passed since Lucille&#x2019;s death. Yet she still felt her old friend&#x2019;s presence around her, hovering in death as she had in life. Dear Lucille. Death came to us all. She knew that. Mamaw was no stranger to death. At eighty years of age, she could hardly have been spared the loss of loved ones. She&#x2019;d buried her parents, and, too early, her son and husband. Tonight she felt the past was more alive than the present. Memories of her loved ones played vividly in her mind.<br> <br>Mamaw drew a long, ragged breath. From far away, she heard the mournful bellowing of a ship&#x2019;s foghorn. From a nearby tree, a bird began calling out his strident dawn whistles . . . a cardinal, she thought.<br> <br>She listened, stirred from her lethargy by the dawn song. She watched as the morning light, in degrees, brightened the skyline, revealing the ragged tips of green sea grass, palm trees clustered on a hammock, and the towering Ravenel Bridge, appearing as two great sailing vessels, in the distance. Slowly, the rising sun illuminated the darkness, peeling away the shroud from her heart. She felt her despair dissipate with the mist. Mamaw said a prayer of thanks to the rising sun and took a deep breath of the cool, mud-scented air.<br> <br>Another day was dawning. The worst was over.<br> <br>Foolish old woman, she chided herself as the gray sky shifted to blue. Look at yourself, sitting in the dark, mourning your friend. Wouldn&#x2019;t Lucille give you what for if she spied you moping like this outdoors in the damp chill, still in your nightclothes? Who had time to lollygag? Their plan for the summer was not finished! She&#x2019;d invited her three nearly estranged granddaughters to Sea Breeze in May&#x2014;and they&#x2019;d come. The first time they&#x2019;d been together in over a decade. True, it had so far been a tumultuous summer of change and growth, ups and downs, joys and heartaches. But it was her triumph that they&#x2019;d weathered the vicissitudes together. Eudora, Carson, and Harper had rediscovered the sisterly love they&#x2019;d shared as children when they played together during the summers here on Sullivan&#x2019;s Island. Howling at the moon? She should be crowing like a rooster!<br> <br>Yet, much was still to be done and she was running out of time. It was already August. The sea turtles were finishing another season, the children would be heading back to school, the ospreys would soon head south with the other migrating birds and butterflies. Summer&#x2019;s end was fast approaching. Soon, too, her Summer Girls would be leaving.<br> <br>Mamaw felt a twinge of loss at just the thought. She would miss them&#x2014;their sweet faces, their chatter, tears, laughter. The footfalls in the house, the drama, the hugs and kisses liberally offered. What a summer it had been!<br> <br>Her smile slipped. Not only would her granddaughters leave in the fall. She, too, would be leaving Sea Breeze. Moving to a retirement home when Sea Breeze was sold. With her granddaughters and Lucille gone, she would, she thought with a shudder, be utterly alone.<br> <br>Mamaw lowered her cheek to her palm. She at least knew where she would go at summer&#x2019;s end, but where would her girls go? Each of the women was unsure of what her next step would be when she left the safe embrace of Sea Breeze. Dora&#x2019;s divorce was pending, Carson was pregnant, and Harper was, for lack of a better term, completely adrift.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Lucille,&#x201d; she said aloud to the presence she felt hovering in the pearly light. &#x201c;You were the one who always rallied me in my dark moments. We lured them here. And there is still much yet to do to finish our plan.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if I can do it alone. But I must try.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mamaw&#x2019;s eyes rose to the sky, where great shafts of pink and blue continued to break through the horizon. A smile eased across her face. The moon might be gone, she thought. But the sun was rising on another day.<br> <br><br> <br>In another room of Sea Breeze, Harper lay on her bed in the steely light, her hands tucked beneath her head, listening to the mighty roar of the ocean. How loud the sound of the waves was this morning, she thought. The echoes reverberated in the still night. She thrilled to the sound, so different from what she was accustomed to in the city.<br> <br>In New York, Harper awoke to the blare of police sirens, honking horns, and banging garbage trucks. So much was different here. She was different here. Over the past few months since she&#x2019;d arrived on Sullivan&#x2019;s Island, her body had slowly acclimated from the fast pace and sense of urgency she experienced in the city to the slower, quieter rhythm of the lowcountry. She no longer went out to parties or bars until late at night, nor did she charge out of bed in the morning at the sound of an alarm. At Sea Breeze her days were ruled by the sun. Early to bed, early to rise.<br> <br>Harper smiled, wondering if she&#x2019;d ever foreseen how much she&#x2019;d enjoy this lifestyle. No, she didn&#x2019;t think she had. In fact, initially she had quite dreaded the prospect of spending time at Sea Breeze this summer. She recalled her outrage when, only a few days after her and her sisters&#x2019; arrival, Mamaw had announced her true intentions: that the women stay the entire summer. Harper stretched languidly while the light brightened to give the room a pearly glow. As she turned to her side to look out the window, her hand brushed against something. Surprised, she sat up to investigate. Sheets of paper lay strewn across her bed and scattered on the floor.<br> <br>She rubbed her eyes as understanding took hold. Her book . . .<br> <br>She must&#x2019;ve fallen asleep while reading her manuscript, she realized, yawning. She rose from her bed and gathered the two-hundred-some sheets into a pile, taking her time to put the pages in order. As she did, her eyes reread a sentence here and there. Not bad, she thought to herself. The emotions in the words felt true. Then again, she was a biased judge. Her mother had made it brutally clear when she was just a girl that she didn&#x2019;t have talent. Just like her father, her mother had said dismissively, waving away Harper&#x2019;s fledgling attempts at short stories and poems. Her mother was a renowned editor, so Harper had taken her words as fact. Those fateful words still stung, even after decades.<br> <br>Since then, Harper hadn&#x2019;t shown her writing to anyone. She&#x2019;d pursued a career as an editor, discovering she had a talent in assisting others with their stories, with taking their innermost thoughts and putting them onto the page.<br> <br>Yet she&#x2019;d found editing others&#x2019; words didn&#x2019;t bring her the same satisfaction as writing her own. So she&#x2019;d continued writing&#x2014;in her room, in coffee shops, on trains&#x2014;in secret. Like a sinful pleasure she could indulge in when she wanted to dish out her anger or amusement. Not until this summer, this block of time she&#x2019;d given herself without interruption&#x2014;or rather, the time that Mamaw had thrust upon her, not taking no for an answer&#x2014;had Harper decided to write a book. A whole body of work with a beginning, a middle, and an end. She would never know whether she could actually write a book until she&#x2019;d finished one. And, she thought, picking up the papers in her hands, she was nearly done.<br> <br>Harper rose and placed the manuscript on her desk, resting her hands on the pile of papers, overcome with a sense of ownership and pride.<br> <br>Her book.<br> <br>Her sisters thought she&#x2019;d been taking the summer off, shamelessly idle while they scrambled to find jobs and apartments. True, she&#x2019;d been enjoying her break at Sea Breeze, gardening, swimming, talking with her sisters, and roaming the far ends of the island. But she&#x2019;d been privately working, too. She didn&#x2019;t dare tell anyone about it, because if she did, she knew they&#x2019;d want to read it.<br> <br>No, she thought, slipping the manuscript into the desk drawer. She would keep her manuscript all to herself. She wasn&#x2019;t as outgoing as her sister Carson, who was quick-witted and clever. Nor was she as bold as her eldest sister, Dora, who had strong opinions on every subject, even when unasked. Harper expressed herself best on paper.<br> <br>And, she thought with a rueful smile, her sisters wouldn&#x2019;t be pleased to learn that she was writing about them.<br> <br>Outside her window she heard the strident dawn whistles of a bird singing in a nearby tree. She paused to listen, wondering what kind of bird it was that awakened her most mornings. She vowed to find out. She wanted to learn the names of the birds and the trees and the plants of this island that she&#x2019;d come to love. She&#x2019;d spent all of her twenty-eight years in beautiful places&#x2014;her mother&#x2019;s fashionable apartment overlooking Central Park in New York City, the house in the Hamptons, and her grandparents&#x2019; manor house in England. Not to mention the exclusive boarding schools and Ivy League college she&#x2019;d attended. But nowhere did she feel so at home or content, or as much herself, as she did here in the lowcountry, by the ocean, at Sea Breeze.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d be leaving soon.<br> <br>The thought came unbidden and struck a chord of sadness in the morning&#x2019;s sweet music. Harper went to the window and opened the wooden slats of the plantation shutter to peer out. Pale gray light illuminated the shadows. Carson was always nattering on about how glorious it was to be out on the water when the dawn exploded over the ocean. How it was her favorite time of the day. Carson could be so passionate about anything connected to water.<br> <br>Harper suddenly felt a stirring to witness that sight for herself. Why not now? she asked herself. Before it was too late. What was she waiting for?<br> <br>She quickly slipped into a swimsuit and denim shorts. Laced up her running shoes. As quietly as the mouse she was nicknamed after, she slipped open the sliding door that separated her bedroom from her grandmother&#x2019;s. It rattled on the track, and grimacing, she paused. She didn&#x2019;t hear Mamaw stir in her dark bedroom. Harper tiptoed quickly across the carpet, closing the door behind her.<br> <br>The house was quiet, everyone still asleep in the wee morning hour. Even Carson, who, for all her talk, had begun sleeping in after announcing her pregnancy. Making good her escape, Harper flew out the front door, aware that the sun waited for no man or woman. She was met with cool and sweet-tasting morning air. The wind that had roiled the ocean all night had chased away the humidity and heat, leaving the morning air unusually refreshing for August. In the quiet, all sounds were amplified. Above her, the leaves of the great oak tree rustled in the breeze and the palm fronds rattled. Beneath her feet the gravel crunched loudly as she hurried across the driveway to the garage. The rusty, trusty old bicycle leaned against the wall. She pulled it out from the garage, swung her leg over the seat, and took off.<br> <br>Despite her twenty-eight years, Harper felt no older than thirteen as she pedaled furiously along the streets. The neighboring houses appeared blanketed in the shadows, their occupants still asleep in the hush over the island. Only a few feral cats darted soundlessly across the roads. She hadn&#x2019;t seen as many of them clustering on the island this summer as she remembered from her girlhood summers spent at Sea Breeze. People said it was the coyotes. She kept her eyes peeled as she pushed on along the muted street. Past Stella Maris Catholic Church, with its hallowed steeple. Past the ominous, giant molelike burrows of Fort Moultrie. Past the tight cluster of restaurants, shuttered now and deserted. Only a few joggers and an occasional automobile shared the road with her.<br> <br>At last she reached the northern tip of the island, where Carson had told her the surfers gathered. She turned off Middle Street toward the sea. Several cars, all with roof racks for surfboards, crowded the narrow side streets. Harper pushed the wheels of her bike through the soft sand of the path past the tall barrier of shrubs. The surf was unusually loud this morning. When at last the path opened up to the beach, she stopped to catch her breath.<br> <br>The dusky blue sky and gray sea came together to form one infinite horizon line. The sun did not rush to her glory. She rose at her own pace, imperious, radiant, bursting in her display of achingly beautiful pastels that were reflected on the water. Harper felt small in the presence of a view so profound. Yet at the same time, she felt connected to it. Empowered to be part of this godlike perpetuity. In that dazzling moment she felt the glistening light enter her soul to fill her with hope. Harper understood at last why Carson so loved this moment, had risen early to catch it day after day. It truly was spiritual.<br> <br>Harper clutched the handlebars of her beach cruiser tight. The new day was spread out before her like a blank page, ready for her to fill with her words, thoughts, feelings. She&#x2019;d given herself this one summer to discover&#x2014;at long last&#x2014;what she wanted to do with her life. No longer would she continue meekly following what her mother had planned.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t know what her future would bring. Standing in the glow of the rising sun, Harper was filled with a tingling sensation that her future was only just beginning.<br> <br><br> <br>The sea was calling her. Carson lay in the dim light of her bedroom listening to the incessant roar of her old friend the ocean. It was rare for the waves to come in hard, as they were now. When they did, Carson had always grabbed her board and gone to the water. It was in her nature to do so. Salt water ran in her veins.<br> <br>Carson didn&#x2019;t jump from her bed this morning, however. She continued to lie still, her palms resting on her abdomen. She no longer was free to follow her whims. No longer the fearless surfer or world traveler, able to pick up and leave when she wished.<br> <br>She let her fingers gently stroke her belly, still flat despite the life growing beneath the taut skin. So much for her womanly intuition. It had taken the echolocation of one very intuitive dolphin to tell her she was pregnant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, baby,&#x201d; she crooned. &#x201c;What am I going to do with you? I&#x2019;m not married, I don&#x2019;t have a job, I don&#x2019;t even have my own place to live. How am I going to take care of you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She brought to mind her last conversation with Lucille, the night she&#x2019;d died. Carson had been struggling with what to do about the pregnancy and went to Lucille to sit at her knee, as she had so many times growing up, and once more ask for advice. Lucille hadn&#x2019;t told her what to do. That wasn&#x2019;t her style. Instead, the old woman guided Carson&#x2019;s thoughts to find her own answer. Carson would never forget ...</p><h2>The Final Reckoning (McMurtrie and Drake Legal Thrillers, 4)</h2><p><p><b>His last challenge: live long enough to save the lives of those he loves.</b></p><p>Cold-blooded killer JimBone Wheeler blames Tom McMurtrie for putting him on death row.

Kline, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at Concordia University in Montr�al. Since earning a doctorate in clinical psychology, he has conducted research on the psychometric evaluation of cognitive abilities, behavioral and scholastic assessment of children, structural equation modeling, training of researchers, statistics reform in the behavioral sciences, and usability engineering in computer science. Dr. Kline has published a number of books, chapters, and journal articles in these areas. His website is <i>http://tinyurl.com/rexkline</i>."Kline is a master at explaining complex concepts in a very accessible manner. It is refreshing to see a new edition of an important book that truly is new, not simply redesigned. The fourth edition successfully incorporates recent developments in SEM and contemporary forms of causal reasoning and analysis, such as the SCM. Unlike most SEM texts, this book is notable for making a sophisticated, often-difficult statistical technique understandable to non-statisticians without watering down the material. Kline makes excellent use of relevant statistical theory without overwhelming the reader with algebraic matrices, proofs, formulas, and statistical notations. I recommend this book without reservation to researchers, instructors, and students in the social and behavioral sciences. It is far more than an introduction to SEM--in my opinion, it is a potential catalyst for reconsidering the statistical methods that researchers apply to better understand human action and interaction."--Chris L. S. Coryn, PhD, Director, Interdisciplinary PhD in Evaluation, Western Michigan University<br><br> "Too often, new editions of statistics books do not have substantive changes, but that is not the case here--Kline has made significant improvements to an already excellent book. Staying current is particularly necessary in SEM, where the theory has been developing rapidly in the last 10 years, yielding, for example, better estimation methods for categorical data and Bayesian methods. Helpful features include the topic boxes, which allow detailed discussion of particular topics without interfering with the overall flow of the text. I also like the exercises at the end of each chapter, which highlight the important parts of the chapter and provide crucial learning opportunities. Kline&#x2019;s use of the companion website to distribute real examples is excellent. After reading about the models and analyses, it is helpful--actually vital--to be able to practice running the models in various software packages."--Craig S. Wells, PhD, Department of Educational Policy, Research, and Administration, University of Massachusetts Amherst<br><br> "The best place to start for anyone who wants to learn the basics of SEM. The text emphasizes applied SEM content without relying on statistical formulas and the writing is clear and well organized, which is very helpful for students. I appreciate having exercises with answers that students can complete and check on their own. The examples are very helpful, and reflect the fact that real data are often troublesome. The website is easy to use and more extensive than for many other books."--Donna Harrington, PhD, University of Maryland School of Social Work<br><br> "The incorporation of Pearl&#x2019;s approach to causal inference is a major improvement in the fourth edition. This is the most useful introductory SEM book out there. I have recommended this book to colleagues for both personal and class use, and will continue to do so."--Richard K. Wagner, PhD, Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professor of Psychology, Florida State University; Associate Director, Florida Center for Reading Research<br><br> &nbsp;"This book is unique in that it treats structural equation models for what they are--carriers of causal assumptions and tools for causal inference. Gone are the inhibitions and trepidation that characterize most SEM texts in their treatments of causal inference. Overall, the book elevates SEM education to a new level of modernity and promises to usher in a renaissance for a field that pioneered causal analysis in the behavioral sciences."--Judea Pearl, PhD, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles<br><br>"Perfectly addresses the needs of social scientists like me without formal training in mathematical statistics....Can be read by any graduate in psychology or even by keen undergraduates interested in exploring new vistas.

In nearly all situations, Kline is able to describe even the more complex material in practical, jargon-free terms....In this regard, this book is unparalleled, and I suspect that this strength alone will make this the book of choice for many who are eager to learn SEM but who do not possess extensive quantitative backgrounds...This book could be readily adapted to courses for students with a basic understanding of correlation and regression or as part of a course for more advanced students."<i></i> (on the second edition), <i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> Published On: 2015-04-06<br><br>"This wonderfully written book is an impressive introduction to structural equation models (SEM) containing a sharp mix of expert analysis and observations....Contains important resources for both theoretical and applied researchers interested in SEMs...Appropriate as a text for graduate students and a reference for researchers, providing both audiences with valuable insight into the subject matter.."<i></i> (on the second edition), <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i> Published On: 2015-04-06</p><h2>The Ape that Understood the Universe: How the Mind and Culture Evolve</h2><p><i> The Ape that Understood the Universe</i> is the story of the strangest animal in the world: the human animal. It opens with a question: How would an alien scientist view our species? What would it make of our sex differences, our sexual behavior, our child-rearing patterns, our moral codes, our religions, our languages, and science? The book tackles these issues by drawing on ideas from two major schools of thought: evolutionary psychology and cultural evolutionary theory. The guiding assumption is that humans are animals, and that like all animals, we evolved to pass on our genes. At some point, however, we also evolved the capacity for culture - and from that moment, culture began evolving in its own right. This transformed us from a mere ape into an ape capable of reshaping the planet, travelling to other worlds, and understanding the vast universe of which we're but a tiny, fleeting fragment.</p><p>The Ape that Understood the Universe is the story of the strangest animal in the world: the human animal. Looking at our species through the eyes of an alien scientist, the book is framed as answer to the alien&#39;s questions about how our minds and culture evolved.Steve Stewart-Williams is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus. His research and writing revolve around the idea that theories from evolutionary biology can shed light on the human mind and behavior, focusing especially on sex differences and altruism. He also has a long-standing interest in the philosophical implications of evolutionary theory.

No confrontation was more brutal and notorious than the massacre of the British garrison of Fort William Henry--an incident memorably depicted in James Fenimore Cooper's <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>. That atrocity stoked calls for revenge, and the tough young Major Robert Rogers and his "Rangers" were ordered north into enemy territory to exact it.<br>On the morning of October 4, 1759, Rogers and his men surprised the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis, slaughtering its sleeping inhabitants without mercy. A nightmarish retreat followed. When, after terrible hardships, the raiders finally returned to safety, they were hailed as heroes by the colonists, and their leader was immortalized as "the brave Major Rogers."

"It seems that things are stirring across the water," the Bard had warned. "Ships are being built, swords are being forged." <br> <br> "Is that bad?" Jack had asked, for his Saxon village had never before seen berserkers. <br> <br> "Of course. People don't make ships and swords unless they intend to use them." <br> <br> The year is A.D. 793. In the next months, Jack and his little sister, Lucy, are enslaved by Olaf One-Brow and his fierce young shipmate, Thorgil. With a crow named Bold Heart for mysterious company, they are swept up into an adventure-quest in the spirit of <i>The Lord of the Rings.</i> <br> <br> Award-winner Nancy Farmer has never told a richer, funnier tale, nor offered more timeless encouragement to young seekers than "Just say no to pillaging."</p><p>Three time Newbery honor author Nancy Farmer's epic fantasy, <i>The Sea of Trolls</i>, is gigantic in every way. There are big Vikings and bigger trolls. There are big themes--hope, despair, life and death. At a substantial 450+ pages, the sheer size of this hefty tome is impressive. But, like all of Farmer's fine work, the large scale has room for enormous quantities of heart and humor. At the center of this massive adventure is a small Saxon boy named Jack, who's never been much good at anything until the Bard of his medieval village makes him an apprentice. Then, just as Jack is learning to tap into and control his power, he is kidnapped (along with his little sister, Lucy) and taken to the court of King Ivar the Boneless and his half troll queen Frith. When one of Jack's amateur spells causes the evil queen's beautiful hair to fall out, he is forced to undertake a dangerous quest across the Sea of Trolls to make things right, or suffer the consequences--the sacrifice of his beloved sister to Frith's patron goddess, Freya. Along the way Jack faces everything from giant golden troll-bears to man-eating spiders, yet each frightening encounter brings wisdom and understanding to the budding young Bard. No quester who enters these pages with Jack will go away unsatisfied. Farmer's skillful melding of history, mythology, and humor, is reminiscent of both Tamora Pierce and Terry Pratchett's medieval fantasies, and will no doubt be HUGELY enjoyed by fantasy readers of all ages. <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i>Nancy Farmer has written three Newbery Honor books: <i>The Ear, the Eye and the Arm</i>; <i>A Girl Named Disaster</i>; and <i>The House of the Scorpion</i>, which also won the National Book Award and the Printz Honor.

His fingers slid over bare wood, and he sat, instantly awake, his skin slick with sweat and the memory of ice. There was no movement in the apartment, no sounds beyond those of the city. The woman beside him rustled in the warm tangle of their sheets, and her hand found the hard curve of his shoulder. &#x201c;You okay, sweetheart?&#x201d;<br>Weak light filtered through the curtains, the open window, and he kept his body turned so she could not see the boy that lingered in his eyes, the stain of hurt so deep she had yet to find it. &#x201c;Bad dream, baby.&#x201d; His fingers found the swell of her hip. &#x201c;Go back to sleep.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You sure?&#x201d; The pillow muffled her voice.<br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; she said, and was gone.<br>Michael watched her fade, and then put his feet on the floor. He touched old scars left by frostbite, the dead places on his palms and at the tips of three fingers. He rubbed his hands together, and then tilted them in the light. The palms were broad, the fingers long and tapered.<br><i>A pianist&#x2019;s fingers,</i> Elena often said.<br><i>Thick and scarred.</i> He would shake his head.<br><i>The hands of an artist&nbsp;...</i><i></i><br>She liked to say things like that, the talk of an optimist and dreamer. Michael flexed his fingers, and heard the sound of her words in his head, the lilt of her accent, and for that instant he felt ashamed. Many things had come through the use of his hands, but creation was not one of them. He stood and rolled his shoulders as New York solidified around him: Elena&#x2019;s apartment, the smell of recent rain on hot pavement. He pulled on jeans and glanced at the open window. Night was a dark hand on the city, its skin not yet veined with gray. He looked down on Elena&#x2019;s face and found it pale in the gloom, soft and creased with sleep. She lay unmoving in the bed they shared, her shoulder warm when he laid two fingers on it. Outside, the city grew as dark and still as it ever got, the quiet pause at the bottom of a breath. He moved hair from her face, and at her temple saw the thread of her life, steady and strong. He wanted to touch that pulse, to assure himself of its strength and endurance. An old man was dying, and when he was dead, they would come for Michael; and they would come for her, to make Michael hurt. Elena knew none of this, neither the things of which he was capable nor the danger he&#x2019;d brought to her door; but Michael would go to hell to keep her safe.<br><i>Go to hell.</i><i></i><br><i>Come back burning.</i><i></i><br>That was truth. That was real.<br>He studied her face in the dim light, the smooth skin and full, parted lips, the black hair that ran in waves to her shoulder then broke like surf. She shifted in her sleep, and Michael felt a moment&#x2019;s bleakness stir, a familiar certainty that it would get worse before it got better. Since he was a boy, violence had trailed him like a scent. Now, it had found her, too. For an instant, he thought again that he should leave her, just take his problems and disappear. He&#x2019;d tried before, of course, not one time but a hundred. Yet, with each failed attempt, the certainty had only grown stronger.<br>He could not live without her.<br>He could make it work.<br>Michael dragged fingers through his hair, and wondered again how it had come to this place. How had things gone so sour so fast?<br>Moving to the window, he flicked the curtain enough to see down into the alley. The car was still there, black and low in the far shadows. Distant lamplight starred the windshield so that he could not see past the glass, but he knew at least one of the men who sat inside. His presence was a threat, and it angered Michael beyond words. He&#x2019;d made his bargain with the old man, and expected the deal to be honored. Words still mattered to Michael.<br>Promises.<br>Rules of conduct.<br>He looked a last time at Elena, then eased two silenced forty-fives from the place he kept them hidden. They were cool to the touch, familiar in his hands. He checked the loads and a frown bent his face as he turned from the woman he loved. He was supposed to be beyond this, supposed to be free. He thought once more of the man in the black car.<br>Eight days ago they&#x2019;d been brothers.<br>Michael was at the door and almost out when Elena said his name. He paused for a moment, then lay the guns down and slipped back into the bedroom. She&#x2019;d shifted onto her back and one arm was half-raised. &#x201c;Michael...&#x201d;<br>The name was a smile on her lips, and he wondered if she was dreaming. She shifted and a warm-bed smell rose in the room. It carried the scent of her skin and of clean hair. It was the smell of home and the future, the promise of a different life. Michael hesitated, then took her hand as she said, &#x201c;Come back to bed.&#x201d;<br>He looked into the kitchen, where he&#x2019;d left the guns next to a can of yellow paint. Her voice had come as a whisper, and he knew that if he left, she would ride the slope back into sleep and not remember. He could slip outside and do the thing he did well. Killing them would likely escalate matters, and others would certainly take their place; but maybe the message would serve its purpose.<br>And maybe not.<br>His gaze traveled from Elena to the window. The night outside was just as black, its skin stretched tight. The car was still there, as it had been the night before and the night before that. They would not move against him until the old man died, but they wanted to rattle him. They wanted to push, and every part of Michael wanted to push back. He took a slow breath and thought of the man he desired to be. Elena was here, beside him, and violence had no place in the world they wished to make. But he was a realist first, so that when her fingers flexed on his, his thoughts were not just of hope, but of retribution and deterrence. An old poem rose in his mind.<br><i>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood&nbsp;...</i><i></i><br>Michael stood at a crossroad, and it all came down to choice. Go back to bed or pick up the&nbsp;guns. Elena or the alley. The future or the past.<br>Elena squeezed his hand again. &#x201c;Love me, baby,&#x201d; she said, and that&#x2019;s what he chose.<br>Life over death.<br>The road less traveled.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The New York dawn came scorching hot. The guns were hidden and Elena still slept. Michael sat with his feet on the windowsill and stared down into the empty alleyway. They&#x2019;d left at around five, backed from the alley and sounded a single blow of their horn as the sightlines collapsed. If their goal had been to wake or scare him, they&#x2019;d failed miserably. He&#x2019;d been out of the bed since three and felt great. Michael studied his fingertips, where flecks of yellow paint stained them.<br>&#x201c;What are you smiling at, gorgeous?&#x201d; Her voice surprised him and he turned. Elena sat up in bed, languorous, and pushed long, black hair from her face. The sheet fell to her waist and Michael put his feet on the floor, embarrassed to be caught in a moment of such open joy.<br>&#x201c;Just thinking of something,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Of me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Liar.&#x201d;<br>She was smiling, skin still creased. Her back arched as she stretched, her small hands fisted white. &#x201c;You want coffee?&#x201d; Michael asked.<br>She fell back against the pillows, made a contented sound, and said, &#x201c;You are a magnificent creature.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Give me a minute.&#x201d; In the kitchen, Michael poured warm milk in a mug, then coffee. Half and half, the way she liked it. Caf� au lait. Very French. When he came back, he found her in one of his shirts, sleeves rolled loosely on her narrow arms. He handed her the coffee. &#x201c;Good dreams?&#x201d;<br>She nodded and a glint sparked in her eyes. &#x201c;One in particular seemed very real.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did it?&#x201d;<br>She sank into the bed and made the same contented noise. &#x201c;One of these days I&#x2019;m actually going to wake up before you.&#x201d;<br>Michael sat on the edge of the bed and put a hand on the arch of her foot. &#x201c;Sure you will, baby.&#x201d; Elena was a late sleeper, and Michael rarely managed more than five hours a night. Her climbing from bed before him was a near impossibility. He watched her sip coffee, and reminded himself to notice the small things about her: the clear polish she preferred on her nails, the length of her legs, the tiny scar on her cheek that was her skin&#x2019;s only imperfection. She had black eyebrows, eyes that were brown but could look like honey in a certain light. She was lithe and strong, a beautiful woman in every respect, but that&#x2019;s not what Michael admired most. Elena took joy in the most insignificant things: how it felt to slip between cool sheets or taste new foods, the moment&#x2019;s anticipation each time she opened the door to step outside. She had faith that each moment would be finer than the last. She believed that people were good, which made her a dash of color in a world blown white.<br>She sipped again, and Michael saw the exact moment she noticed the paint on his hands. A small crease appeared between her brows. The cup came away from her lips. &#x201c;Did you paint it already?&#x201d;<br>She tried to sound angry but failed, and as he shrugged an answer to the question he could not keep the smile from touching every part of his face. She&#x2019;d envisioned them painting it together&#x2014;laughter, spilled pai...</p><h2>Illustrated Adventure Stories</h2><p>This is a rip-roaring collection of knuckle-whitening adventure stories retold for younger readers.

David Conrad, who recorded a new version of the epic, has now crafted a prose translation that preserves the oral flavor of live performance.

His maps, and his notes on the maps, are terrific.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The <i>Sunjata</i> epic speaks to the founding of the great empire of Mali.

To me, this prose translation is&#x2013;in spite of absence of some songs typical for the&nbsp;<i>Sunjata&nbsp;</i>narrative&#x2013;an excellent visualization in print of a performance of the&nbsp;<i>Sunjata&nbsp;</i>epic, in all its complexity. . . .

We are who we are in large part because of what we learn and remember. But how does the brain create memories? Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel intertwines the intellectual history of the powerful new science of the mind&#x2015;a combination of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and molecular biology&#x2015;with his own personal quest to understand memory. A deft mixture of memoir and history, modern biology and behavior, <em>In Search of Memory</em> brings readers from Kandel's childhood in Nazi-occupied Vienna to the forefront of one of the great scientific endeavors of the twentieth century: the search for the biological basis of memory.</p><p>Eric R. Kandel is Kavli Professor and University Professor at Columbia University and senior investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000. He lives in New York City.When, as a medical student in the 1950s, Kandel said he wanted to locate the ego and id in the brain, his mentor told him he was overreaching, that the brain had to be studied "cell by cell." After his initial dismay, Kandel took on the challenge and in 2000 was awarded a Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research showing how memory is encoded in the brain's neuronal circuits. Kandel's journey into the brain spans five decades, beginning in the era of early research into the role of electrical currents flowing through neurons and ending in the age of genetic engineering. It took him from early studies of reflexes in the lowly squid to the founding of a bioengineering firm whose work could some day develop treatments for Alzheimer's and on to a rudimentary understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying mental illness. Kandel's life also took him on another journey: from Vienna, which his Jewish family fled after the <i>Anschluss</i>, to New York City and, decades later, on visits back to Vienna, where he boldly confronted Austria's unwillingness to look at its collusion in the Final Solution. For anyone considering a career in science, the early part of this intellectual autobiography presents a fascinating portrait of a scientist's formation: learning to trust his instincts on what research to pursue and how to pose a researchable question and formulate an experiment. Much of the science discussion is too dense for the average reader. But for anyone interested in the relationship between the mind and the brain, this is an important account of a creative and highly fruitful career. 50 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Vocalist D. Randall "Randy" Blythe was looking forward to a few hours off&#x2014;a rare break from the touring grind&#x2014;in which to explore the elegant old city. However, a surreal scenario began to play out at the airport as Blythe was detained, arrested for manslaughter, and taken to Pankr�c Prison&#x2014;a notorious 123-year-old institution where the Nazis' torture units had set up camp and where today hundreds of prisoners are housed in claustrophobic, sweltering, nightmare-inducing conditions.<br><br>What transpired during Blythe's incarceration, trial, and eventual acquittal is a rock 'n' roll road story unlike any other, one that runs the gamut from tragedy to despair to hope and finally to redemption. Blythe is a natural storyteller and his voice drips with cutting humor, endearing empathy, and soulful insight. Much more than a tour diary or a prison memoir, <i>Dark Days</i> is D.

Throughout, the grandfather offers encouragement to the younger bunny: "Be brave and take chances,/ have fun and enjoy,/ each moment, my love,/ my pride, and my joy."

Readers follow &#x201c;Dr. C&#x201d; as he tracks down biblical, archaeological, and geographical clues to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, narrowing the list of possible sites as he weighs evidence and battles skeptics. Finally, he arrives at a single location that looms as the only option: a massive ancient ruin called Tall el-Hammam in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. <br> <br>Many scholars who were initially opposed to Dr. Collins&#x2019;s theory now concede that history books may need to be rewritten in light of his groundbreaking discovery. It&#x2014;along with several other recent finds&#x2014;is challenging the assumptions of academics and asserting a new voice in the controversy of biblical archaeology and the dispute over using the Bible as a credible historical source.<br> <br>***<br> <br>From respected archaeologist Dr. Steven Collins and award-winning author Dr. Latayne C. Scott comes the fascinating, true account of the frustrating search and exciting excavation of the city the Bible calls Sodom, which scholars and others had &#x201c;misplaced&#x201d; for hundreds of years. <br> <br>Like many modern-day Christians, Dr. Collins struggled with what seemed to be a clash between his heritage of belief in the Bible and the research regarding ancient history and human evolution. This crisis of faith led him to embark on a quest to put both his archaeological education and the Bible to the test by seeking out the lost ancient city, an expedition that has led to one of the most exciting finds in recent archaeology. <br> <br>Challenging the assumptions of academics around the world, <i>Discovering the City of Sodom </i>may well inspire a revision of the history books. Dr. Collins has become a new voice in the controversy over using the Bible as a credible source of understanding the past&#x2014;and opened a new chapter in the struggle over the soul of biblical archaeology.</p><p><b>Dr. Steven Collins</b> is Executive Curator of the Museum of Archaeology and Biblical History, Dean of the College of Archaeology and Biblical History at Trinity Southwest University, and Visiting Professor of Archaeology at Veritas Evangelical Seminary.<br><br><b>Latayne Scott</b>&#x2019;s<b> </b>previous books include <i>The Mormon Mirage</i>.Discovering the City of Sodom ONE<p></p> Down from the Jordan&#x2019;s Source: The Setting for Sodom<p></p> <br>To understand the role of the once-great city-state of Sodom, you must visualize where it is in relation to the rest of the history of the Semitic people in whose land it lies. Though the recent discovery of Sodom seemed to come out of nowhere, it has been in the same place for thousands of years. It must take its proper place on both maps and timelines of Bible events.<br> <br>It often surprises those who love the Bible when they learn that most of that book&#x2019;s events took place in a footprint smaller than the state of New Jersey. Excepting the sojourns of biblical people in Egypt and captivity in Babylon (and of course the travels of the apostles after the time of Jesus), practically everything biblical happened in an eight-thousand-square-mile skinny rectangle that transects the so-called Fertile Crescent, which stretches from the Arabian gulf to the borders of the Nile River in Egypt.<br> <br>Once a year, Albuquerque, New Mexico&#x2013;based Trinity Southwest University conducts an archaeological study tour of the Holy Land, crossing back and forth over the fortified but nonetheless amicable borders between Jordan and Israel to see the most significant sites. The grand prize of the tour is a look at Tall el-Hammam&#x2014;biblical Sodom&#x2014;over the last days of the tour, of course. But all of Holy Land history, all of the Holy Land itself, is as knitted together as the souls of David and Jonathan. And the lifeblood of the Hebrew people&#x2019;s history is the river in its heart, and the logic of its story follows the great Jordan River south to the Dead Sea. To understand biblical history you must follow the Jordan&#x2014;whose very name means &#x201c;descent&#x201d;&#x2014;as it makes its way through the geography of biblical history.<br> <br>The narrow rectangle of the Holy Land is split, quite literally, right down the middle by the profound valley of the Jordan River. Unlike the upside-down Nile, the Jordan runs north to south through an area called the Great Rift. This long, deep fissure, formed in antiquity by the shifting of adjacent tectonic plates, stretches from Turkey all the way to the Serengeti Plain in Africa. Its once-suboceanic past is revealed by its mountaintops, which are here and there crusted with fossils that even today crunch underfoot.<br> <br>In the Holy Land, this Rift&#x2019;s northern border is defined by the Lebanon Mountains and the iconic Mount Hermon, the &#x201c;grey-haired mountain&#x201d; whose summit marks the border of modern Israel. Its fifty-foot drifts of snow have inspired psalms, such as the one that compares fellowship to &#x201c;the dews of Mount Hermon.&#x201d; The same snow provides one source of the Jordan River&#x2019;s headwaters and is perhaps the site of the Transfiguration of Jesus, where he communed with Moses and Elijah (Mark 9:2&#x2013;5).<br> <br>(How did the apostles know the identity of those two long-dead men when they saw them with Jesus? a guide asks, and then allows guesses until the right answers appear: Moses by the great light coming from his face&#x2014;Exodus 34:35&#x2014;and Elijah by his bald head and excessively hairy body&#x2014;2 Kings 1:8.)<br> <br>Northern Israel is a thin, vulnerable place, a bruised and bloodied fist that jabs toward its menacing neighbors. Even if there weren&#x2019;t fortified fences, anyone could see the borders of Israel: just as Egypt is the gift of the Nile, Israel is the gift of drip irrigation. Just across Israel&#x2019;s barbed-wire borders, where the green ends and the brown begins, lie both Lebanon and Syria and the reasons for bomb shelters in every kibbutz; the signs on the roadside tell you not to walk past the shoulder because there are mine-fields there.<br> <br>Visitors try to digest the reality of still-active land mines in a civilized country. They ponder the irony of mosques in Israel and the contradiction of its population of 12 percent of Muslims, whose Quran-reading children take part in the Israeli army&#x2019;s compulsory service for all its young citizens.<br> <br>This is a place millions have dreamed of visiting since they heard the Bible stories of childhood. Proportionally, more come here from non-English-speaking countries than not. The popular tourist sites are a Babel&#x2014;or perhaps, a Pentecost&#x2014;of groups, huddled in semicircles as they listen to discourses in their native tongues by hoarse and earnest tour guides with waving arms.<br> <br>American groups contain all types of people. On one extreme are people like the middle-aged Arkansas farmer who tries to figure out how to anchor on his head the little yarmulke with the blue Star of David that he&#x2019;s just bought from a vendor (and whether or not he should rock back and forth as he prays, as he sees the black-coated Hasidic Jews do). On the other side of the scale is the chattering group of schoolgirls who have been sent here with the hope that old sacrednesses will rub off on them and stick to their clothing when they return to the malls and MP3s of their lives. Somewhere in the middle are the pious families and the young couples who haul their unwitting children from site to site and try to take notes and photographs and videos of every important thing.<br> <br>And in Israel, every site is an important thing. There is no other place on earth about which so many uncounted libraries have been written. It&#x2019;s surely the most documented eight thousand square miles on earth.<br> <br>Some tourists are lured by the churches and mosques built over most of the familiar places: the Temple, the Nativity, the Holy Sepulcher, and the holies of other assorted holies. But a tour specializing in Israel&#x2019;s archaeology disdains everything Byzantine and newer (&#x201c;Second century AD, huh? Move on!&#x201d;) and takes the pilgrim first to the fount of every blessing, the bubbling-up emergence of the Jordan River&#x2019;s pristine waters from the very ground at a place called Tel Dan. Here is a lush habitat for birds and salamanders and fish that climb waterfalls, a place where dew and moss drip from everything.<br> <br>Under excavation and deteriorating in the sopping air at Laish (Tel Dan) down the road is a mudbrick gateway, with perhaps the oldest arch in existence&#x2014;through which Abraham may have passed on his route from Haran to his inheritance in Canaan (Genesis 12:4&#x2013;5). Literally a few steps away are the stone foundations of a gateway where kings of his Israelite descendants sat centuries later, arbitrating disputes among the people. Gateways such as this do not always endure, but their stone foundations usually do. Perhaps that is why the idea of a gateway and heaven have become tied together in people&#x2019;s minds.<br> <br>Adjacent to it is Caesarea Philippi, the place where Jesus pointed up to a gaping mouth of a cave into which pagans threw human sacrifices to Pan&#x2014;perhaps subdued by hallucinogens still discernible in excavated ancient drinking vessels. Here Jesus brought his disciples on a six-day journey out of their way, to this place of decision. Here he told his disciples that what he would build, the open heart of a church, would not be a matter of flesh and blood, would not be overcome by such things as this gate into hell (Matthew 16:13&#x2013;20).<br> <br>The river falls precipitously a few miles downstream into the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias, as it&#x2019;s also named in the Bible). Tourists ride in loaded barges across it and eat basketfuls of the grilled St. Peter&#x2019;s tilapia (named after that apostle&#x2019;s famous eureka of a coin in the jaws of one of these mouth-breeding fish, as recorded in Matthew 17:24&#x2013;27). Later, everyone gawks at the recently found &#x201c;Jesus boat,&#x201d; a wooden fishing vessel from the first century improbably preserved in Galilean mud until its discovery and restoration just a few years ago.<br> <br>It isn&#x2019;t Jesus&#x2019;s sailing ship, though, because he didn&#x2019;t own anything. In modern terms, he would have gone to Hertz Rent-a-Boat when he needed one.<br> <br>On the northwest shore of the lake is Capernaum, one of three cities cursed by Jesus. Yet that same city was extraordinarily blessed when he healed a servant of the man who built its synagogue. This man, a Roman centurion, possessed and immortalized what Jesus called &#x201c;astonishing&#x201d; faith (Luke 7:1&#x2013;10).<br> <br>A Christian guide points out the exact middle of the tiled floor. All ancient synagogues are perfect squares, he tells visitors, like God spreading himself over the four corners of the earth. Look here, he says, this is where Jesus would have stood to read. This synagogue floor is much more modern than in Jesus&#x2019;s day, but the floor from his time lies beneath this one. People go and stand next to that spot, wanting proximity, fearing usurpation lest they crowd out his memory.<br> <br>The archaeological tour doesn&#x2019;t go to Nazareth, for there is little ancient to see there. Instead, the visitors look out at what Jesus would have seen from there: a breathtaking landscape that would have been his history book. There everyone could see Mount Tabor&#x2019;s unmistakable mammary profile, the fitting setting of the story of the extraordinary heroine Deborah when she and Barak conquered the king of Hazor (Judges 4). The sight of Mount Carmel, across the valley, evokes the telling of the fire from heaven that ignited Elijah&#x2019;s waterlogged firewood and sent the pagan priests running in terror, history&#x2019;s first cutters, still dripping blood from their self-inflicted skin-slicing (1 Kings 18).<br> <br>Then the guide points out Sepphoris, a neighboring city not mentioned in biblical texts but that was a bustling building project during the teenage and young adult years of Jesus. His father Joseph, the guide explains, was a tekton, a word whose meaning can include the concept of a carpenter but more probably meant a builder or artisan, perhaps even a stonemason. How many times, as the guide points out, did Jesus speak of stonework, of cornerstones, capstones, foundations, towers? (See Matthew 24:27 and elsewhere.)<br> <br>Then he tells of a recent discovery in close-by Nazareth, under what is called &#x201c;the trench of St. Joseph,&#x201d; of a mikva or ritual bath found only in the homes of wealthy Jews. The question arises: Were Joseph and Son successful regional construction experts? Did Jesus give up a successful career and comfortable lifestyle to become a hounded itinerant rabbi?<br> <br>No archaeological tour of the Holy Land is complete without several days in Jerusalem. No matter from which direction you come to that city, you always come up, because it&#x2019;s a mountain in a valley-bowl surrounded by hills. Though situated in the world&#x2019;s most overdocumented country, this is the most disputed real estate on the planet, its very soil in a constant and intractable tug-of-war between Muslims and Jews and Christians.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s as if all of history is distilled and concentrated here so potently that no one wants to share it. Everywhere are ruins and buildings under excavation. The Israeli government&#x2019;s commitment to archaeology is more than just a scientific endeavor; it&#x2019;s the Jewish nation&#x2019;s attempt to confirm an entire history that a Muslim world would deny ever existed.<br> <br>The repatriation of Jerusalem by non-Arabs, the Arabs say, is just a repeat of the Crusades.<br> <br>Remembrance is the key to salvation, Jews say; forgetfulness leads to exile.<br> The Witnesses<p></p> <br>The old City of David excavations bear witness to a Jewish past: Gihon Spring, David&#x2019;s water shaft, Hezekiah&#x2019;s Tunnel, and Warren&#x2019;s Shaft, the Siloam Pool.<br> <br>People emerge with the story on their shoulders and heads, green with moss, from the newly excavated sewers through which the rich people of Jerusalem attempted to escape the Romans in 70 CE.<br> <br>The uncovering and restoration of the house of the high priest, in whose courtyard the prisoner Jesus stood, verifies.<br> <br>The Garden of Gethsemane, the once-smoldering Hinnom Valley, Herod&#x2019;s palace, the Mount of Olives, all testify.<br> <br>And of course the retaining walls of the temple, with massive stones of over a hundred tons each, thirty feet long, unmoved for more than two millennia from the place where Herod&#x2019;s workers placed them and today without even a razor&#x2019;s width between them, mutely communicate an implacable story.<br> <br>On the archaeological tour, a bearded man with close-cropped gray hair points up to where he has discovered features hidden for millennia. This is Dr. Leen Ritmeyer and the Temple Mount is his adopted homeland, his real estate, and he is the unquestioned expert on this site of all sites. In fact, many of the reconstruction drawings in Jerusalem&#x2019;s museums and drawings on government-sponsored tour signs in the city are by Ritmeyer. He is a recorder of archaeological data, the extrapolator of it, interpreter of new discoveries such as the famous trumpeting sign on the Temple Mount. He is legend to non-Arab archaeologists and at the same time a persona non grata, banned from the Muslim Dome of the Rock and its surrounding precinct.<br> <br>The modern city of Jerusalem is a jumble. Viewed from the outside, its very topography exemplifies and illustrates the contradictions of Israel. It is peaks and valleys, inclusions and exclusions, history and future, one side moistened by the Mediterranean and heavily wooded, the other cracked, dry desert.<br> <br>The desert. The Hebrew word for desert is the same as the word for hearing. Throughout its history, people went to the desert to listen: Jesus &#x201c;shoved&#x201d; by the Holy Spirit (as the koine Greek of Mark 1:12 describes it) into desolate places to hear the voice of Satan, the apostle Paul then tutored by Jesus whispering in the winds of the Arabian dunes (Galatians 1:12&#x2013;17). Both were heirs of the legacy of Old Testament prophets sent into sandy exile, where they too heard voices from beyond this world.<br> <br>There is little of archaeology in the desert places of Israel, but its few sites are stark and memorable.<br> <br>Qumran, of course, is the essence of the speaking of the desert itself, which divulged in 1947 the long-silent Dead Sea Scrolls. These famous documents were written (it is supposed) by Essenes who built their desert community in homage to parchment and what could be immortalized on it, intentionally facing library and scriptorium east, to get rid of moisture. Ritmeyer concurs, saying that he can&#x2019;t begin any of his architectural drawings in the Holy Land until the sun comes up and dries the paper.<br> <br>He taps with his foot the crust of the unique sandy soil that closes itself up and sheds water. No wonder the scrolls survived the ages in their clay jars. Could there be more of them? Perhaps the desert might still have muted voices waiting to speak.<br> <br>Near the southwestern shore of the Dead Sea towers its most iconic desert symbol of Jewish nationalism, Masada, the fortress/palace city of Herod. Still visible from its breath-catching heights are the outlines of the camps of an entire legion of Roman soldiers who over a six-month period built a huge siege ramp up to the captured fortress to try to kill more than 900 occupying Jewish men, women, and children.<br> <br>Rations alone for the legion would have totaled more than $36 million in modern currency. What was the great threat? Was it to Roman pride, losing a garrison because its guards, who thought it impregnable, were careless?<br> <br>Centuries before the Romans, King David once ascended and secreted himself on the heights of Masada, as 1 Samuel 23:14 indicates when it speaks of his hiding in a &#x201c;stronghold&#x201d; in the Judean desert. But his favorite desert hideout from the wrath of King Saul (1 Samuel 24:1) was the lush slit in the Judean hills, the lovely and surprising En-Gedi. At its summit is a concave of caves, with a dagger of light and water into it...</p><h2>Warriors: The Lost Warrior</h2><p><p><strong>A graphic novel adventure from the world of Erin Hunter&#x2019;s #1 nationally bestselling Warriors series!</strong> </p><p>In the first book of the Graystripe&#x2019;s Adventure manga arc, follow ThunderClan warrior Graystripe after he is captured by Twolegs in <em>Warriors: The New Prophecy #3: Dawn&#x2014;</em>and embarks on a difficult journey home.</p><p>When the Twolegs destroy the warrior Clans' forest home, ThunderClan deputy Graystripe is captured trying to help his comrades escape!

Dwier Brown played Kevin Costner&#x2019;s father for five minutes at the end of the movie Field of Dreams. Despite being an actor for 35 years and performing in hundreds of other films, plays and television shows, it was those five minutes that changed his life. Since the movie&#x2019;s release in 1989, Brown has been recognized by dozens of fans who have told him poignant stories about their fathers and how watching the film changed their lives.

First published in France in 1825 and continuously in print ever since, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin&#x2019;s masterpiece is a historical, philosophical, and epicurean collection of recipes, reflections, and anecdotes on everything and anything gastronomical. Brillat-Savarin&#x2014;who famously stated &#x201c;Tell me what you eat and I shall tell you what you are&#x201d;&#x2014;shrewdly expounds upon culinary matters that still resonate today, from the rise of the destination restaurant to matters of diet and weight, and in M. F. K. Fisher, whose commentary is both brilliant and amusing, he has an editor with a sensitivity and wit to match his own.</p></p><p><p><b>Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin</b> (1755&#x2013;1826) was a lawyer and the mayor of Belley, France, before he fled the Revolution in 1793. After a brief exile in the United States,&nbsp; he returned to Paris and was appointed a judge in the court of appeals. He spent the last twenty-five years of his life living peacefully in Paris and writing <i>The Physiology of Taste</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher</b> (1908&#x2013;1992), author of <i>Consider the Oyster,</i> <i>How to Cook a Wolf, </i>and more than twenty other books about the art of eating well, is widely acknowledged as a pioneer of food writing as a literary genre.</p>The book is &#x2014; what? Does anyone know? Intermittently it is an autobiography, but told principally in dinner anecdotes (except one, which is about a breakfast, but so protracted that it, too, becomes dinner). It is not a cookbook, although the next time you are bestowed with a turbot the size and awkwardness of a small bicycle you will know how to cook it (too big to fit in the oven, the sea creature is effectively steamed in the tub). The difficulty is compounded by the book's opening, which invites us to think of it as something it never becomes. In the first two pages, we learn that a meal without cheese is as incomplete as a woman without an eye, a startling comparison to contemplate. We also learn that a dinner is never boring &#x2014; at least for the first hour; that a new dish matters more to human happiness than the discovery of a star; that if, at the end of a meal, you are sated and slurring, you do not know how to eat and drink; and, most famously, that you are what you eat, a succinct expression of food and identity repeated so relentlessly that it is now a modern advertising banality. These ''Aphorisms of the Professor'' (''to serve as a preamble to his work and as a lasting foundation for the science of gastronomy'') represent a lifetime of one-liners, the stuff that, revised, scribbled into a notebook, rehearsed and repeated over a fortified beverage, kept the bachelor scholar from ever having to dine alone. But after page 2, the aphorisms disappear. Instead, there is history. Should we trust it? The Professor is not an historian. Or is he? There is science, more science than history, actually a lot of science. Do we dismiss it because we know better? Do we? Who is this guy anyway?</p><h2>How Stella Saved the Farm: A Tale About Making Innovation Happen</h2><p><p><i>How Stella Saved the Farm</i> is a simple parable about making innovation happen.

In the seven years since its first publication, that book has reached more people than I could have ever imagined, many of whom have applied its principles and who have written me to say that their health and well-being improved significantly after changing what they eat. Many people asked that I put together a more structured eating plan along with additional information, recipes, and resources for primal eating. Primal Fat Burner does just that. But the book you are about to read isn&#x2019;t necessarily a weight loss book.<br> <br>Fat&#x2014;including saturated fat&#x2014;is nowhere near the bad guy we used to think it was. Eating fat can make you thin. Primal Fat Burner helps you harness the best dietary practices of our ancestors with the most current scientific understanding of nutrition. With this knowledge you can use quality dietary fat and the rich abundance of critical nutrients contained within it to create total health and well-being.<br> <br>I am not simply here to tell you that &#x201c;fat isn&#x2019;t as bad as you might have heard,&#x201d; or &#x201c;fats are okay, just as long as you keep them to a minimum,&#x201d; or &#x201c;fats are okay just as long as you stick to strictly unsaturated fats.&#x201d; I am here to supply you with a mountain of compelling evidence that fats from animals that eat a natural diet not only are essential to your health but have served more than any other dietary adaptation to literally make us human.<br> <br>In Primal Fat Burner, based on the latest science and research, I explain why eating foods rich in dietary fat (while avoiding the consumption of sugars and starch and moderating protein intake) is the best and most natural nutritional approach for your complete health and well-being. This book emphasizes (in part) a low-carbohydrate approach to eating. There is far more to the plan, but you will find that the fewer utilizable carbs you consume and the less insulin your body needs to produce, the better your long-term health will likely be.<br> <br>Primal Fat Burner focuses on the single biggest factor in your health and longevity: the primal fat-burning diet, a modification of what is commonly known as a ketogenic diet. This approach to food is radically different from our current nutritional status quo&#x2014;but in many ways it is the oldest form of nutrition in human history. A fat-based ketogenic diet has powered humans and our pre-human hominid ancestors through almost all of our three million years of evolution, and it is a critical tool that has the power to reduce weight, strengthen resilience, and reverse many of the chronic diseases of today.<br> <br>As a clinical nutritionist and ancestral nutrition expert, I consult and lecture with health seekers around the globe. Countless times I&#x2019;ve seen clients and audience members meet the word ketogenic with equal doses of fascination, trepidation, and misunderstanding: &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that Atkins? Starvation? A medical treatment? For hard-core health nuts?&#x201d; Having devoted my life to understanding the evolution of our metabolic functioning, I can assure you that a well-balanced ketogenic approach to eating is none of those things. Nor is it especially controversial. Surprise: the fat-burning ketogenic diet is actually our norm, and it is fundamental to our human design as breathing. It simply means using the energy from fats found in real foods, in the form nature intended them, as your primary source of fuel. When this is explained, what was once mysterious starts to become commonsense.<br> <br>Over the fifteen or so years that I have followed a primal fat-burning protocol myself, I&#x2019;ve worked with and counseled a remarkably diverse client population. At one end of the spectrum are those battling significant weight issues or serious ailments, from type 2 diabetes to early onset dementia. Often, the pain of the solutions they&#x2019;ve been offered by medicine and mainstream nutrition exceeds the pain of the problem, so they come to primal fat burning in order to take things into their own hands. In the middle of the spectrum are women and men approaching middle age, or sometimes advanced age, who look healthy but who have discovered that they have underlying, unhealthy, and elevated blood sugar levels and other troubling blood test markers. They have been following seemingly balanced, carb-friendly ways of eating that have been invisibly ravaging their physiology&#x2014;even though they still fit into their jeans.<br> <br>At the far other end of the spectrum is a different crowd: people who are consciously eating what they consider to be a &#x201c;paleo&#x201d; diet (yes, I said &#x201c;consider to be&#x201d;&#x2014;more on that later) but who have not gotten the results they are seeking; primal eaters who have drifted slowly from their low-carbohydrate goals and need help (or a swift kick in the pants) to reboot their program and to focus and dial in on their efforts; and elite or endurance athletes who are harnessing the energy from dietary fats to powerfully boost their performance.<br> <br>If you&#x2019;ve picked up this book piqued by the idea of becoming a primal fat burner, chances are you fall somewhere on this arc. You might have long struggled with diets that don&#x2019;t work, or despaired at ever achieving a lean physique. Like me, you might have a deeply personal experience with depression, anxiety, or low energy. Or maybe you are watching others in your family suffer from health issues you know to be genetic, and you want to do anything you can to avoid those diseases yourself. Women and men of all ages simply want to feel better, live longer, and look and feel younger, with a clearer mind and most certainly a leaner and more resilient body that they inhabit proudly. They want to enjoy every day of their lives&#x2014;whether young, middle-aged, or older&#x2014;and they resist what is sold to us as the &#x201c;inevitable&#x201d; modern-day aging scenario of prescription drugs in their bathroom cabinet. They refuse to sign up for one of the so-called diseases of civilization&#x2014;diabesity, depression, dementia and brain degeneration, heart disease, cancer. If this is &#x201c;civilized,&#x201d; they are saying, they&#x2019;d rather be primal!<br> For the Love of Fat<p></p> <br>Fat has recently become the darling of the health world. In numerous peer-reviewed studies scientists are exonerating fat for health crimes it didn&#x2019;t commit. For fifty years, fat was vilified by an aggressive anti-fat campaign, which shunted it out of its rightful place on our plate to make way for excesses of carbohydrates.<br> <br>While I am glad that fat has finally won some redemption, its acceptance has been a little begrudging and timid. Most experts are all open arms when it comes to fat-rich, plant-based foods. And they&#x2019;re pretty friendly with fish. They suggest modest little drizzles of this and splashes of this and that&#x2014;and a quarter of an avocado, if you please.<br> <br>As for me, please pass the lard. I wrote Primal Fat Burner to the beat of a much louder drum and with the intention of blazing a bolder path. This book is based on the fundamental scientific understanding that all fats, especially fats from healthy animal sources and unrefined tropical oils, are paramount to the functioning of our physiology and to our robust health. These formerly maligned fats must be wholeheartedly reclaimed as vital to our health. Animal-sourced fats provide sustaining energy and absolutely critical fat-soluble nutrients. Without them, we would not have become who we are as humans.<br> <br>In Primal Fat Burner I will take you on a journey of discovery. I will show you how humans&#x2019; ability to &#x201c;run on fat&#x201d; defined how our remarkable body and brain functioning evolved&#x2014;and why the modern shift to &#x201c;running on sugars&#x201d; has been one of the most egregious missteps in human history. I will share why the natural fats found in wholesome real foods, in particular the fats from animals that eat a diet of grasses and other natural forage, are a match for your genetic makeup and help you achieve a stable weight and robust health&#x2014;and how the lack of these things can dangerously erode your well-being. And I&#x2019;ll explain why naturally fat-rich foods, used correctly, are the foundation of an optimal way of eating that (with some minor tweaks in individual implementation) is relevant to everyone.<br> <br>Then I take you further. I will give you tools that can help you become a lean and energized fat burner yourself.<br> <br>In Parts One, Two, and Three, I share everything you need to know about how a fat-burning metabolic state functions and why it is your natural state. You&#x2019;ll discover that the cells of your body, in particular the cells of your heart and brain, thrive on fat. And you&#x2019;ll learn that not all calories are created equal. I explain how using ketones, the energy units of fat, instead of glucose, the energy from carbohydrates in the form of starches and sugars, gives you a life-changing (and potentially lifesaving) metabolic advantage. This advantage not only affects your entire quality of life but can be measured quantitatively on your blood work panels.<br> <br>The real goal of Primal Fat Burner is to show you how to ignite your fat-burning metabolism&#x2014;think of metabolism as the mechanism of converting food to fuel&#x2014;by using a well-balanced and high-quality ketogenic diet. When you switch on your fat-burning metabolism and allow it to stay on continuously by maintaining this way of eating every day, the results can be tremendous. You create the conditions to achieve a healthy and stable weight, even if you are very overweight. That&#x2019;s because, once your body adapts to relying primarily on ketones and free fatty acids for energy, it starts using your fat reserves for fuel, instead of storing them on your belly, love handles, hips, and thighs. Your brain runs sharper and better, too&#x2014;an effect that can stay with you for life. Imbalances in blood sugar and insulin as well as inflammation can be resolved, with the effect of stabilizing, reducing, or even eliminating chronic pain and disease.<br><br>SWITCH ON A WELL-ADAPTED, FAT-BURNING STATE AND YOU LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR:<br> <br>�&nbsp;Easier weight loss, without excessive hunger or cravings, and long-lasting energy<br> <br>�&nbsp;Reduced blood sugar issues, lower hemoglobin A1C and other metabolic markers associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes<br> <br>�&nbsp;An anti-inflammatory effect and a dampening of excess free radical activity (which causes harmful tissue damage and is a driver of disease and aging)<br> <br>�&nbsp;Anti-aging effects, with improved cellular regeneration and repair mechanisms and healthier, younger-looking skin<br> <br>�&nbsp;Improved sleep<br> <br>�&nbsp;Improved immune function<br> <br>�&nbsp;Reduced blood pressure<br> <br>�&nbsp;Stabilized neurological functioning in the brain, which makes you less susceptible to migraines, panic attacks, mood swings, and seizures, and reduces your risk of neurodegenerative diseases&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and more<br><br>And all these benefits come from making a basic but consistent modification to your diet, eating moderate protein from clean, sustainable, and nutrient-enhancing sources, ample fibrous vegetables and greens, and as much fat as you need to satiate your hunger. By the end of Part One, you&#x2019;ll come to an empowering understanding: you can decide whether to be a fat burner or sugar burner, simply by eating certain real, whole foods and avoiding others. This makes you the agent of your own well-being and longevity.<br> <br>Then, in Part Four, I hand you the road map you need to make the metabolic switch yourself. To make it simple and achievable, I&#x2019;ve outlined a 21-day plan that gives you step-by-step guidance. It includes sixty simple recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks; guidance on how to prepare, cook with, and store all kinds of healthy fats; and balanced weekly meal plans. It also lays out how to prepare yourself physically and how to avoid common pitfalls during the transition period.<br> <br>Shifting to an effective and well-adapted fat-burning metabolism takes between three and six weeks for most people. Once initiated, this fat-burning metabolic state becomes a fairly effortless new norm. I&#x2019;ll also walk you through exactly what to do if fatigue or discomfort arises during this transition time.<br> <br>When you are successfully using the energy of fat for fuel, you are in what I call a state of effective ketogenic adaptation (EKA). In this book, we&#x2019;ll be following a unique approach that combines a state of EKA with high-level nutrition derived from quality food sources and support against stress and toxicity. This is primal fat burning.<br> <br>The effects of primal fat burning are:<br> <br>Energizing. You benefit from enduring energy that takes you easily from one meal to the next without snacks or cravings.<br> <br>Protective. Your mitochondria&#x2014;the cellular powerhouses that supply energy and guard against aging, among other important functions&#x2014;are protected. The health of your heart and brain is safeguarded, and those organs&#x2019; efficiency and function are greatly enhanced.1<br> <br>Regulating. Your blood sugar and insulin levels are given the conditions to normalize and function more efficiently, as nature intended.2 Excess weight that has been resistant to diets can be regulated, as trapped fat stores get mobilized for energy.3<br> <br>Stabilizing. Brain function and moods normalize and stabilize when the brain is fed with fat.4 Emotional struggles around food, such as cravings and even certain eating disorders, can subside or be eliminated.<br> <br>Anti-aging. Human longevity markers improve (including thyroid efficiency), and overall disease risks related to inflammatory markers, cholesterol (which tends to elevate with inflammation), and more are naturally lowered.5<br> <br>Completely safe. A fat-based ketogenic diet based on the Primal Fat Burner Plan is safe for almost everyone&#x2014;with some possible exceptions, which I will explain in detail. With guidance from a physician, it can also be modified for specific needs, such as pregnancy or nursing, type 1 diabetics, the increased growth rates of children and teens, and the demands of high-intensity athletics.<br> <br>The Primal Fat Burner Plan has a varied and satisfying menu. You&#x2019;ll eat grass-fed, fat-rich meat and wild-caught seafood; greens and other fibrous vegetables and sprouts; nuts and a few seeds; probiotic-rich, fermented foods; and homemade bone broth. You&#x2019;ll find that the plan described in this book is also:<br> <br>Achievable. It&#x2019;s refreshingly straightforward and simple to execute.<br> <br>Enjoyable and efficient. The tasty, satiating food is easy to make for yourself and your family.<br> <br>Familiar. It&#x2019;s a return to wholesome, traditional foods you may already know and love.<br> <br>Affordable. You&#x2019;ll consume fewer packaged, pre-made foods and snacks. You&#x2019;ll wisely use quality ingredients, including cheaper cuts of high-quality meat (and bones), and indulge in fewer pricey splurge foods and nutritionally empty treats.<br> <br>Liberating. By shifting from primarily sugar as fuel (which is addicting and damaging) to mainly slow-burning fat, you are freed of urgent cravings and the sudden, intense need to eat (which come from a dependency on carbs). You&#x2019;ll discover a new relationship with farmers and other sources of health-giving food. Most important, your relationship to food and eating will become clearer, healthier, and more resilient. It is a far saner, happier way to be.<br> <br>Some of the information that follows might seem radical at first. Stay with me: you will see that this approach to caring for your health is in fact quite rational. Primal Fat Burner is based on a deep understanding of our ancestral origins. It is a foundational way of eating with an unshakable basis in evolutionary scien...</p><h2>My Journey to Heaven: What I Saw and How It Changed My Life</h2><p>On April 28, 2006, as he lay in his hospital bed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, visions of celestial beauty were the last thing on Marv Besteman's mind.

[A] fascinating and exciting work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ray Olson, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A sense of hope underlies the series, and it can be read as the struggle of the everyman to shirk off the yoke of oppression and to circumvent the cycle of slavery that war begets.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Shea Hennum, <em>Paste</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;...<em>The Eternaut</em>&nbsp;is a particularly compelling work, and it occupies an interesting point in Latin American literature. ... In much the same way that Tarantino spins poetry from trash cinema, Oesterheld constructs a political allegory out of sci-fi serials and adventure novels. ...[I]ts apocalyptic lens facilitates its argument that anything can be overcome by unity, by refusing to accept oppression; it is, at the end of the day, a paean to the human spirit.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Shea Hennum, <em>The A.V.

With the outstanding clarity for which he is famous, Nunn breaks down complex problems into bite-sized pieces.<br> <br>In the case of attacking play, we are shown how to decide where to attack, and the specific methods that can be used to pursue the enemy king. Positional play is described in terms of the major structural issues, and how the pieces work around and with the pawns. Nunn explains how to assess when certain pieces are better than others, and how we can make use of this understanding at the board. Readers will never be short of a plan, whatever type of position arises.<br> <br>Each lesson features two inspiring examples from modern chess, annotated honestly and with a keen focus on the main instructive points.

The family arrived in Quebec, where they found clothes at the flea market, and mattresses with actual fleas. Kim learned French and English, and as she grew older, seized what opportunities an immigrant could; she put herself through school picking vegetables and sewing clothes, worked as a lawyer and interpreter, and later as a restaurateur. She was married and a mother when the urge to write struck her, and she found herself scribbling words at every opportunity - pulling out her notebook at stoplights and missing the change to green. The story emerging was one of a Vietnamese �migr� on a boat to an unknown future: her own story fictionalized and crafted into a stunning novel.</p><p>The novel's title, <i>Ru</i>, has meaning in both Kim's native and adoptive languages: in Vietnamese, <i>ru</i> is a lullaby; in French, a stream. And it provides the perfect name for this slim yet potent novel. With prose that soothes and sings, <i>Ru </i>weaves through time, flows and transports: a river of sensuous memories gathering power. It's a classic immigrant story told in a breathtaking new way.</p></p><p><p><b>Kim Th�y </b>was born in Saigon and arrived in Canada at age ten in 1978. She has degrees from the University of Montreal in linguistics and translation and in law, and has been appointed a Knight of the Ordre national du Qu�bec. In 2017, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Concordia University, for giving eloquent voice to the refugee experience, and the Medal of Honour of the National Assembly of Qu�bec. </p><p><b>Sheila Fischman </b>is a two-time winner of both the Canada Council Prize for Translation and Columbia University's Felix-Antoine Savard Award, and has also received the Governor General's Award for Translation and the Molson Prize for the Arts.</p>I came into the world during the Tet Offensive, in the early days of the Year of the Monkey, when the long chains of firecrackers draped in front of houses exploded polyphonically along with the sound of machine guns.<br>&nbsp;<br>I first saw the light of day in Saigon, where firecrackers, fragmented into a thousand shreds, coloured the ground red like the petals of cherry blossoms or like the blood of the two million soldiers deployed and scattered throughout the villages and cities of a Vietnam that had been ripped in two.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was born in the shadow of skies adorned with fireworks, decorated with garlands of light, shot through with rockets and missiles. The purpose of my birth was to replace lives that had been lost. My life&#x2019;s duty was to prolong that of my mother.<br><br>My name is Nguyen An T&#x1ecb;nh, my mother&#x2019;s name is Nguyen An Tinh. My name is simply a variation on hers because a single dot under the <i>i </i>differentiates, distinguishes, dissociates me from her. I was an extension of her, even in the meaning of my name. In Vietnamese, hers means &#x201c;peaceful environment&#x201d; and mine &#x201c;peaceful interior.&#x201d; With those almost interchangeable names, my mother confirmed that I was the sequel to her, that I would continue her story.<br>&nbsp;<br>The History of Vietnam, written with a capital H, thwarted my mother&#x2019;s plans. History flung the accents on our names into the water when it took us across the Gulf of Siam thirty years ago. It also stripped our names of their meaning, reducing them to sounds at once strange, and strange to the French language. In particular, when I was ten years old it ended my role as an extension of my mother.<br><br>Because of our exile, my children have never been extensions of me, of my history. Their names are Pascal and Henri, and they don&#x2019;t look like me. They have hair that&#x2019;s lighter in colour than mine, white skin, thick eyelashes. I did not experience the natural feelings of motherhood I&#x2019;d expected when they were clamped onto my breasts at 3 a.m., in the middle of the night. The maternal instinct came to me much later, over the course of sleepless nights, dirty diapers, unexpected smiles, sudden delights.<br>&nbsp;<br>Only then did I understand the love of the mother sitting across from me in the hold of our boat, the head of the baby in her arms covered with foul-smelling scabies. That image was before my eyes for days and maybe nights as well. The small bulb hanging from a wire attached to a rusty nail spread a feeble, unchanging light. Deep inside the boat there was no distinction between day and night. The constant illumination protected us from the vastness of the sea and the sky all around us. The people sitting on deck told us there was no boundary between the blue of the sky and the blue of the sea. No one knew if we were heading for the heavens or plunging into the water&#x2019;s depths. Heaven and hell embraced in the belly of our boat. Heaven promised a turning point in our lives, a new future, a new history. Hell, though, displayed our fears: fear of pirates, fear of starvation, fear of poisoning by biscuits soaked in motor oil, fear of running out of water, fear of being unable to stand up, fear of having to urinate in the red pot that was passed from hand to hand, fear that the scabies on the baby&#x2019;s head was contagious, fear of never again setting foot on solid ground, fear of never again seeing the faces of our parents, who were sitting in the darkness surrounded by two hundred people.<br><br>Before our boat had weighed anchor in the middle of the night on the shores of Rach Gia, most of the passengers had just one fear: fear of the Communists, the reason for their flight. But as soon as the vessel was surrounded, encircled by the uniform blue horizon, fear was transformed into a hundred-faced monster who sawed off our legs and kept us from feeling the stiffness in our immobilized muscles. We were frozen in fear, by fear. We no longer closed our eyes when the scabious little boy&#x2019;s pee sprayed us. We no longer pinched our noses against our neighbours&#x2019; vomit. We were numb, imprisoned by the shoulders of some, the legs of others, the fear of everyone. We were paralyzed.<br>&nbsp;<br>The story of the little girl who was swallowed up by the sea after she&#x2019;d lost her footing while walking along the edge spread through the foul-smelling belly of the boat like an anaesthetic or laughing gas, transforming the single bulb into a polar star and the biscuits soaked in motor oil into butter cookies. The taste of oil in our throats, on our tongues, in our heads sent us to sleep to the rhythm of the lullaby sung by the woman beside me.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father had made plans, should our family be captured by Communists or pirates, to put us to sleep forever, like Sleeping Beauty, with cyanide pills. For a long time afterwards, I wanted to ask why he hadn&#x2019;t thought of letting us choose, why he would have taken away our possibility of survival. I stopped asking myself that question when I became a mother, when Dr. Vinh, a highly regarded surgeon in Saigon, told me how he had put his five children, one after the other, from the boy of twelve to the little girl of five, alone, on five different boats, at five different times, to send them off to sea, far from the charges of the Communist authorities that hung over him. He was certain he would die in prison because he&#x2019;d been accused of killing some Communist comrades by operating on them, even if they&#x2019;d never set foot in his hospital. He hoped to save one, maybe two of his children by launching them in this fashion onto the sea. I met Dr. Vinh on the church steps, which he cleared of snow in the winter and swept in the summer to thank the priest who had acted as father to his children, bringing up all five, one after the other, until they were grown, until the doctor got out of prison.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t cry out and I didn&#x2019;t weep when I was told that my son Henri was a prisoner in his own world, when it was confirmed that he is one of those children who don&#x2019;t hear us, don&#x2019;t speak to us, even though they&#x2019;re neither deaf nor mute. He is also one of those children we must love from a distance, neither touching, nor kissing, nor smiling at them because every one of their senses would be assaulted by the odour of our skin, by the intensity of our voices, the texture of our hair, the throbbing of our hearts. Probably he&#x2019;ll never call me <i>maman </i>lovingly, even if he can pronounce the word <i>poire </i>with all the roundness and sensuality of the <i>oi </i>sound. He will never understand why I cried when he smiled for the first time. He won&#x2019;t know that, thanks to him, every spark of joy has become a blessing and that I will keep waging war against autism, even if I know already that it&#x2019;s invincible. Already, I am defeated, stripped bare, beaten down.</p><h2>Country Brocante Style: Where English Country Meets French Vintage</h2><p><b>Find inspiration in decorative country living with <i>Country Brocante Style</i>.</b><br><br>Lucy Haywood is the creator of The Country Brocantes&#x2014;home and lifestyle fairs held in idyllic rural surroundings.

With close to 1000 Peanuts images included, all created by Schulz himself, no true Peanuts library would be complete without this final volume. As a fitting end to The Complete Peanuts series, Jean Schulz, who was instrumental in putting this beloved series together, provides an emotional introduction to the volume.</p><p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p><strong>Jean Schulz</strong> is the widow of Charles Schulz and President of the Board of Directors at the Charles M.

As in medical muscle testing, AK muscle testing utilizes full-strength contraction of the muscle tested. To perform the AK muscle test, the examiner provides isometric resistance while the patient maximally contracts the chosen muscle. Then the examiner applies a bit more pressure. If the client cannot resist this extra pressure, the muscle "tests weak," indicating a problem or imbalance that needs to be resolved. This type of strong physiological muscle test is especially accurate for the diagnosis of organ disturbances. Further applications include working with a muscle that tests strong "in the clear" as a diagnostic tool to determine the effect of stimuli including touch, nutrients, medicines, allergens, emotions, poor posture, and stressful memories.&nbsp;<br>Opening with a detailed description of the history and applications of Applied Kinesiology, the book covers the theory, procedure, and intepretation of the muscle test including diagnosis and correction techniques for areas of weakness. Thirty-three muscle tests for different areas of the body are accompanied by instructive photographs with superimposed anatomical drawings that demonstrate the method and various treatment points. A useful appendix includes a glossary of anatomical terms and special vocabulary; a step-by-step plan for conducting a session; and a list of contacts and sources for Applied Kinesiology materials. Offering a new preface and additional techniques in the areas of manual medicine, orthomolecular medicine, and psychology, this revised edition shares the author's discoveries as well as anecdotal observations to stimulate further research. <br><br>Table of Contents:<br>Foreword; Introduction; Chapter 1: From Biomechanics to Applied Kinesiology; Chapter 2: Scientific Principles of Applied Kinesiology; Chapter 3: The Muscle Test; Chapter 4: Pretests; Chapter 5: Diagnosis and Correction Techniques; Chapter 6: Muscle Tests; Chapter 7: Applied Kinesiology and Manual Medicine; Chapter 8: Applied Kinesiology and Orthomolecular Medicine; Chapter 9: Applied Kinesiology and the Psyche; Chapter 10: Personal Discoveries and Garnered Methods for Further Consideration; Appendices; Index</p><p>ROBERT FROST received degrees in psychology, biology, and physics from the University of California, Santa Cruz.

This practical book helps you sort it out, first by grounding you in agile's underlying principles, then by describing four specific--and well-used--agile methods: Scrum, extreme programming (XP), Lean, and Kanban.<br>Each method focuses on a different area of development, but they all aim to change your team's mindset--from individuals who simply follow a plan to a cohesive group that makes decisions together. Whether you're considering agile for the first time, or trying it again, you'll learn how to choose a method that best fits your team and your company.<br><ul><li>Understand the purpose behind agile's core values and principles</li><li>Learn Scrum's emphasis on project management, self-organization, and collective commitment</li><li>Focus on software design and architecture with XP practices such as test-first and pair programming</li><li>Use Lean thinking to empower your team, eliminate waste, and deliver software fast</li><li>Learn how Kanban's practices help you deliver great software by managing flow</li><li>Adopt agile practices and principles with an agile coach</li></ul></p><p>Understanding Scrum, XP, Lean, and KanbanThis book is called Learning Agile because we <b>really</b> want you to learn agile. We've spent the last 20+ years working with real teams building real software for real users day in and day out. We've also spent the last 10+ years writing books about building software (including two very successful books in the O'Reilly <i>Head First</i> series about managing projects and learning to code). This experience has helped us find many different ways to get complex and technical ideas into your brain without boring you to death.<br> We've done our best to take this material and make it as interesting and engaging as possible. We use narratives and illustrations, include key points and coaching tips, and answer many frequently asked questions that routinely come up when teams try to implement agile in the real world on their own teams&#x2014;and all of these things can help you and your team learn agile quickly so that you can build and deliver better, more valuable software, and do it faster than before.<br> <b>Who we wrote this book for</b><br> Do any of these scenarios describe you and your team?<br> You tried an agile practice, but it didn't really work out. Maybe you implemented daily standup meetings, and now your team meets every day--but you still get blindsided by problems and miss deadlines. Or you started writing user stories and reviewing them with your team and stakeholders, but your developers still find themselves dealing with just as many last-minute changes to add extra features that continue to pop up. Or maybe your team tried to go agile wholesale by adopting a methodology like Scrum or XP, but it seems somehow "empty"--like everyone is going through the "required" motions, but your projects are only marginally improving.<br> Or maybe you haven't tried agile yet, but you recognize that your team is facing serious challenges, and you don't know where to start. You're hoping that agile will help you with those demanding users who constantly change their minds. Each change your users make requires more work for your team, and leads to "duct tape and paperclips" spaghetti code solutions that make the software increasingly fragile and unmaintainable. It could be that your projects are simply controlled chaos; the primary way software is delivered is through long hours and personal heroics, and you think that agile may offer your team a way out.<br> What if you're an executive who's worried that teams working on important projects will fail to deliver? Maybe you've heard about agile, but you don't really know what it means. Can you simply tell your team to adopt agile? Or will you need to change your own mindset along with the team?<br> If any of those situations is familiar to you, and you want to improve how your team works, this book will help.<br> We explain the agile methodologies: why they're designed the way they are, what problems they address, and the values, principles, and ideas that they embody. By giving you the "why" in addition to the "how," we'll help you to recognize the principles that apply to the particular development problems specific to your team, company, and projects. And we'll show you how to use that information to guide your choice of methodologies and practices.<br><br> <b>What we want for you:</b> <ul> <li>We want you to understand the ideas that drive effective agile teams, and the values and principles that bring them together.</li> <li>We want you to understand the most popular agile schools of thought--<b>Scrum</b>, <b>XP</b>, <b>Lean</b>, and <b>Kanban</b>--and how they can all be agile, even though they're very different from each other.</li> <li>We want to teach you specific agile practices that you can apply to your projects today--but we also want to give you the framework of values and principles that you'll need to implement them effectively.</li> <li>We want to help you understand your own team and company better, so that you can choose an agile approach that matches your mindset (or comes as close as possible)--but also help you and your team start to learn a new way of thinking that will help you become a more effective agile team.</li> </ul></p><h2>Amazing Truths: How Science and the Bible Agree</h2><p><p>Does science discredit the Bible, God, religious faith?

To the hard-bitten people of the depressed and violent West, the whiskey tax paralyzed their rural economies, putting money in the coffers of already wealthy creditors and industrialists. To Alexander Hamilton, the tax was the key to industrial growth. To President Washington, it was the catalyst for the first-ever deployment of a federal army, a military action that would suppress an insurgency against the American government. <br><br>With an unsparing look at both Hamilton and Washington, journalist and historian William Hogeland offers a provocative, in-depth analysis of this forgotten revolution and suppression. Focusing on the battle between government and the early-American evangelical movement that advocated western secession, <i>The Whiskey Rebellion </i>is an intense and insightful examination of the roots of federal power and the most fundamental conflicts that ignited&#x2014;and continue to smolder&#x2014;in the United States.</p><p><b>William Hogeland</b> has published in numerous print and online periodicals, including <i>The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly,</i> and <i>Slate.</i> He lives and writes in Brooklyn, New York.The Whiskey Rebellion PROLOGUE<p></p> The President, the West, and the Rebellion<p></p> <br>President Washington was traveling home to Virginia in June of 1794 when he got hurt.

Rifling through papers, he looked for proof of things people claimed he&#x2019;d said, waving off polite reminders from subordinates who, the president could see, were shaken by pinholes in his memory.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d been embodying republican judgment for so long that what might have been oppressive requirements of office&#x2014;audiences, dinners, dances, teas&#x2014;seemed to come naturally. In black velvet or purple satin, his huge frame, still magnificently straight, could endow any occasion with serenity and seriousness, with grace. Yet what George Washington really had to do all day was apply his enormous capacity for administrative thoroughness to a pile of awful problems that grew more numerous all the time. They were problems of mere survival. The Royal Navy was seizing U.S. ships. The British Army declined to evacuate forts on U.S. soil. Indian wars brought carnage but no progress. Washington had been harried, throughout his first term, by battles within his own cabinet: Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton undermined each other and, inevitably, Washington&#x2019;s efforts. Yet both men had been essential to him. Now Jefferson had quit to lead the nation&#x2019;s first opposition party. Hamilton, still in the cabinet, ever more essential, led the party in power. Of all dangers to the new nation, Washington was sure that party politics would be the deadliest.<br> <br>So he was relieved to be able to get home at all this spring. The trip would be so brief that Mrs. Washington had remained in Philadelphia, and when traveling without her, Washington liked to push the pace, keeping the journey to five days. Yet the weather was hot, the horses out of shape, and presidential travel a production. The president&#x2019;s light, long-distance coach went bouncing over ruts, holes, and rocks. Up top sat the driver and a postilion, both in livery. Riding alongside was a secretary; on the other side a friend might ride as bodyguard. Some ways behind, the baggage wagon lumbered; behind the wagon stepped the president&#x2019;s saddle horse, led by a mounted slave. Overnight stops meant dinners, tours of friends&#x2019; properties, ride-alongs, and side trips. And there was frequent communication with the office.<br> <br>Washington didn&#x2019;t want rest. What he wanted, the only reason for taking this quick break, was to be working on Mount Vernon, his five farms on eight thousand acres. He&#x2019;d been trying for most of his life to make Mount Vernon both a self-sufficient manor in the ancient Roman style and a source of wealth through the sale of produce. Such an estate would normally be ancestral home to a dynasty, but while his wife had borne her first husband four children, George Washington had none. On soil made almost barren by tobacco cultivation before he&#x2019;d inherited it, he experimented with common crops like wheat and corn and with exotics like treebox, grapes, horse chestnuts, clover, and gourds. He&#x2019;d planted five kinds of fruit trees. He&#x2019;d spent years fighting the encroachment of waste by sprinkling plaster on soil, sowing oats and peas, searching in manure for what he called the first transmutation toward gold: fertility. He bred cattle, mules, hogs, sheep, and horses. Support came from smithies, charcoal burners, carpentry shops, mills, looms, cobblers, breweries, creameries, and a fishery. Voluminous accounts were kept separately for each farm, and more than three hundred people managed&#x2014;most enslaved, many indentured, some free. At the foot of Mount Vernon&#x2019;s lawns, the product of all this hard-won fecundity was loaded from wharves onto boats in the Potomac.<br> <br>Yet Washington always had great difficulty keeping the place on a paying basis. Each week in Philadelphia he sat at a desk and wrote his farm manager page after page of instructions, caveats, reminders, neatly hand-drawn crop-rotation tables and charts; each week he required an equally detailed report in response. He was sure his managers were incompetent, his workers selling butter on the side, his slaves lazy and poorly managed. Finally he couldn&#x2019;t stand it any longer. With the end of the congressional session, he pushed the cabinet to close executive business, snatched a few weeks from the nation, and started south to give Mount Vernon the personal attention it desperately needed.<br> <br>After too many days on the road, almost home now, he decided on a quick side trip. He wanted to inspect the construction zone on tidal marshes known as the Great Columbian Federal City; one day it would bear his name. Touring the site, he could see the congressional building and the president&#x2019;s house, separated by bleak woods, still scaffolded, under construction. Those two buildings were all that suggested potential for civilization. Washington had been trying to whip up interest in land sales that were supposed to be funding the venture, but buyers were few, and it wasn&#x2019;t hard to understand why. The mall existed only on paper and included an open sluice for sewage. Most people saw this site as wet, buggy scrub.<br> <br>What George Washington saw was a city that didn&#x2019;t struggle upward from necessity and convenience. Purpose-built, it would be a neoclassical commercial and political center, surrounded by manorial farms like his own, organizing agrarian bounty and financial savvy, the north and the south, Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians, in the wisdom and strength of central government. The city would serve as an embarkation point for products of the rich, fresh soil of the interior, barely tapped, yet already owned and controlled in massive tracts by George Washington, his fellow tidewater planters, and northern speculators. The western produce would tumble, one day, out of the mountains, ride down the Potomac, and be dispatched into the Chesapeake Bay and across the Atlantic for the markets of Europe. When that happened, both the Federal City and the president&#x2019;s huge landholdings in the west would assume enormous value.<br> <br>There was an obstacle to realizing this dream, something he needed to look at, again, on this side trip. The Potomac, spreading as an estuary alongside the future capital city, then quietly passing Mount Vernon&#x2019;s lawns, seemed hospitably southern here near the bay. Follow it upstream, though&#x2014;Washington had done so for the first time more than forty years earlier&#x2014;and even before leaving civilization you came to white cataracts, sluices, drop-offs, rocky twists and turns; the river narrowed and became unnavigable. Above the fall line it leveled for a shallow stretch, then steepened again, regaining speed and fight. Arriving many days later at the highest springs, a good surveyor would be disappointed to note that in the western mountains the river simply petered out. Moving western produce eastward called for a road to the shore. The Potomac wasn&#x2019;t it.<br> <br>The president knew the Potomac, and he knew the west. Near the crest of the Appalachians, where other streams rise, Washington the redhead colonial had panted his way up the most forbidding passes in the country. Among ice chunks in the raging Allegheny he&#x2019;d swum for his life. He&#x2019;d hauled chains and tripods; he&#x2019;d led snooty superiors to places where, of white men, only he and his rough scouts had been before. He&#x2019;d followed the streams that flowed down the other way and converged at the headwaters of the Ohio River, which cut southwest and poured at last into the Mississippi; he&#x2019;d floated the Ohio looking for good land. What Washington had been puzzling over since his teens was how to make the tricky, east-flowing Potomac somehow navigable, then connect it&#x2014;and thus connect Mount Vernon, and now his Federal City&#x2014;by a high, wide road across the mountains, to the west-flowing Ohio, thence with the Mississippi, at last with the gulf. He was weaving a mental network that might pull divergent watersheds together, gathering up a continent&#x2019;s opposing forces, tilting the American west toward the eastern shore.<br> <br>Yet lately he&#x2019;d grown discouraged. After a lifetime of purchasing western tracts and attempting development, he found his far-off property still squatted on, his rents uncollected. Law in the west was disastrously incompetent. Mills needed constant repair yet never produced enough to make expenditures worthwhile. His land agents were passive. He&#x2019;d started exploring the possibility of selling off his western lands.<br> <br>It was a dream that would die hard. After taking a look at his Federal City-in-progress, the president, mounted now, turned not downstream toward home but upstream for a quick inspection of his most exciting east&#x2013;west project, the canal works at the Potomac&#x2019;s lower falls. The young man&#x2019;s imaginings had long since been put busily into practice: he&#x2019;d been made president of the Potomac Company long before becoming president of the United States. Here at the fall line, engineers were taking a standard approach. They diverted flow into trenches dug beside the river; wood-gated, stone-walled locks would float boats up steps. It was above the falls, in the second phase, where the great vision was projected. Washington and his business partners planned to avoid cutting waterways beside the river. They&#x2019;d dig out the banks instead, take the fight out of the currents by widening the river, dispense with locks; they&#x2019;d make a new Potomac, an interstate highway, level and calm, pursuing it into the mountains till defeated by the river&#x2019;s narrowing. Then phase three: the overland mountain road, which they imagined congested, someday, with wagons portaging goods eastward from the Ohio River.<br> <br>The president&#x2019;s horse lurched. It lurched again. From the rocks above the lower falls, he&#x2019;d been viewing the construction; the horse&#x2019;s feet were tender, the ground was hard, and suddenly the horse couldn&#x2019;t stop running and bucking. Washington was giving all he had to staying in the saddle and keeping himself and the horse from hurtling down the rocks into rushing water. When he succeeded at last in pulling the horse to a panting halt, his back was in such excruciating pain that he couldn&#x2019;t stay mounted.<br> <br>He got down with difficulty, joined by his anxious party. Virginia gentry saw themselves as horse-tamers out of Homer. Washington was deemed the greatest rider of his age. Now he couldn&#x2019;t hoist himself into the saddle. With help, he did at last mount up, but the pain was paralyzing and getting worse. At Mount Vernon at last, but unable to stand, he lay around the house. Hands-on management required day-long gallops over miles of country. He was used to dismounting, taking off his coat, joining in the work. In battle, flying lead had torn holes in his clothes while men fell screaming around him, and when dysentery swept through the ranks, it had killed dozens while making him temporarily miserable. An often-told story placed him in the sights of a crack British rifleman, overwhelmed by the nobility of the target, who couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to shoot. It was amazing but true: never before, in a long and persistently dangerous career, had George Washington been injured. This damage to his back, he was told, would be with him the rest of his life.<br> <br>Furious, he left Mount Vernon, having done nothing, riding back toward Philadelphia in a coach on what he&#x2019;d been advised was the smoothest road. The road wasn&#x2019;t smooth. He sat rigid with pain, day after day, as the carriage bounced and swayed. Rain started falling, then pouring. The entourage slowed in the mud. He caught a bad cold. After seven days of misery he arrived at Philadelphia, planning to go straight to bed, but a party of Chickasaws, he was told, had arrived days earlier and patiently awaited a meeting with the president.<br> <br>Washington went to dinner. He had world-famous posture; in the presence of Indians there was no question of reclining or even slouching. He sat up straight, smoking the peace pipe and exchanging polite remarks. He badly wanted to make another trip to Mount Vernon, somehow, as soon as possible.<br> <br>What the president didn&#x2019;t know, as he forced himself upright for one more diplomatic dinner: attempts at federal law enforcement, over the mountains in his old Ohio River stomping grounds, had run into a kind of trouble the United States hadn&#x2019;t yet faced. He wouldn&#x2019;t return to Mount Vernon soon. The old general, with his wrenched and faulty back, would be leading troops again, making his last trip west.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The national crisis that came to be known as the Whiskey Rebellion, a scene of climactic moments in the lives of famous founders like George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, and in those of equally determined and idiosyncratic Americans whose names have been forgotten, began in the fall of 1791, when gangs on the western frontier started attacking collectors of the first federal tax on an American product, hard liquor. The attacks took lurid and, to contemporaries, familiar form. The attackers&#x2019; faces were blackened; the victims were tortured and humiliated. Sometimes the gangs dressed as their own worst nightmare. Stripped to deerskin breeches, they streaked their chests and faces with herb-dyed clay and stuck feathers in their hair, imitating a native raiding party. Or they borrowed their wives&#x2019; dresses. Black faces framed by white caps, they kicked the awkward skirts while confronting human prey.<br> <br>Those attacks would develop, over the course of more than two years, into something far more frightening to eastern authorities than freakish rioting: a regional movement, centered at the headwaters of the Ohio in western Pennsylvania, dedicated to resisting federal authority west of the Alleghenies. In the fall of 1794, the rebellion would climax when President Washington raised thirteen thousand federal troops&#x2014;more than had beaten the British at Yorktown&#x2014;and led them over the Appalachians, where armed Americans were no longer petitioning for redress, or carrying out grotesque attacks on officers, but leading a secessionist insurgency against the United States of America.<br> <br>The perpetrators were the toughest and hardest of westerners: farmers, laborers, hunters, and Indian fighters; most were disillusioned war veterans. Expert woodsmen and marksmen, adept not only in musket drill but also in rifle sharpshooting, they were organized in disciplined militias and comfortable with danger. The president&#x2019;s decision to suppress the rebellion, in which he deployed the first federal force of any significant size&#x2014;and led it as commander in chief&#x2014;became a test of the fragile new nation&#x2019;s viability, the biggest news of the day. Triggered by the tax on domestic whiskey, with which the prodigiously energetic Alexander Hamilton was realizing his visions of high finance and commercial empire, the rebellion brought to a climax an ongoing struggle not over taxation but over the meaning and purpose of the American Revolution itself.<br> <br>That struggle had financial, political, and spiritual aspects. In the most literal sense it was about paying the revolution&#x2019;s debt. The whiskey rebels weren&#x2019;t against taxes. They were against what they called unequal taxation, which redistributed wealth to a few holders of federal bonds and kept small farms and businesses commercially paralyzed. Farmers and artisans, facing daily anxiety over debt foreclosure and tax imprisonme...</p><h2>The Bitter Season (Kovac and Liska Series)</h2><p><b>Kovac and Liska take on multiple twisted cases as #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author Tami Hoag explores a murder from the past, a murder from the present, and a life that was never meant to be.</b>&nbsp;<br><br>As the bitter weather of late fall descends on Minneapolis, Detective Nikki Liska is restless, already bored with her new assignment to the cold case squad.

He loved the motion&#x2014;pulling back, stretching his body taut like a crossbow then releasing the power in his muscles. He probably put more into it than was necessary to get the job done. He didn&#x2019;t care. This was his workout, his therapy, his outlet for the toxic emotions that built up inside him all week.<br><br><i> Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> There was a rhythm to it he found soothing, and a violence he found satisfying.<br><br> Day in and day out he dealt with people he would sooner have sent to hell: the dregs of society, sickos and perverts. The things he&#x2019;d seen would make the average citizen vomit and give them nightmares. He lived in a horror story, fighting a losing battle with no end in sight.<br><br> He&#x2019;d been working Sex Crimes for seven years now. His initial efforts to remain detached from the grime of it had gradually worn him out. His plan to do a brief turn in the unit then use it as a springboard to a more prestigious position in another department had eventually crumbled and collapsed in on itself.<br><br> Turned out he was damned good at the job that sucked him into the filthy gutter of human depravity. And the longer he did it, the better he became. And the better he became, the harder it was to escape. The harder it was to escape, the bigger the stain on the very fabric of his soul. The deeper the stain soaked in, the greater his understanding of the minds of the predators he hunted. The greater his understanding, the more his idealistic self chipped away, the more the filth soaked into him until the only thing he recognized of his original self was the face in the mirror every morning&#x2014;and even that was eroding.<br><br> He had always been a good-looking guy, with chiseled features and smooth skin and a thick head of jet-black hair. The face that stared back at him these days as he shaved had aged twice as fast in half as much time as his twin brother&#x2019;s. Every day the lines seemed deeper, the eyes emptier, the hair thinner and grayer. He was becoming something he didn&#x2019;t want to recognize, inside and out.<br><br> And so he chopped wood on the stump of an elm tree out behind his house.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> He lived in an older neighborhood of square two-story clapboard houses with front porches that had mostly been closed in against the brutal Minnesota winters, and backyards separated by tall, weathered privacy fences. His property backed onto a large, rambling park that surrounded one the city&#x2019;s many lakes. The park let him have the illusion of living in the woods.<br><br> Mr. Lumberjack, living in the woods, swinging his axe.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> Despite the cold wet weather, he was sweating inside the layers of clothing he wore&#x2014;thermal underwear, a flannel shirt, a down-filled vest. He hated this time of year. Every day was shorter than the last. Night began to fall in late afternoon. Winter could arrive on any given day, and stay until April. They had had an ice storm on Halloween and a blizzard on Veteran&#x2019;s Day, followed by three days of rain that had caused flash flooding in low-lying areas. The odd day of stunning, electric blue skies and a paltry few lingering fall colors couldn&#x2019;t make up for the stretches of bleak gray or the damp cold that knifed to the bone. It buried its blade between his shoulders as he wiped the moisture from his face on the sleeve of his shirt, and hoisted the axe again.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack!</i><br><br> The temperature was dropping quickly. The intermittent spitting rain that had been falling off and on all afternoon was giving way to a pelting snow that cut like tiny shards of glass, stinging his ruddy cheeks.<br><br> Every winter he bitched about the Minnesota weather and vowed to move to Florida the day he retired from the police department. But if he moved to Florida, he wouldn&#x2019;t have any reason to split wood. What would he do for his sanity then?<br><br> Like he stood any chance of getting away from here anyway, he thought, looking up at the house, where lights had come on in the kitchen and in one bedroom upstairs. His family all lived in Bloomington. Barbie The Ball Buster&#x2019;s family was entrenched in the southern suburbs. The kids had all their cousins and friends here.<br><br> Maybe he should go alone. Maybe everyone would be happier if he did.<br><br> He sighed and picked up another chunk of wood, set it on end on the stump, stepped back and swung the axe.<br><br> Mr. Lumberjack. Mr. Sex Crimes Detective of the Year. Featured speaker at conferences all over the Midwest. Expert on the subject of human degradation.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> He tried to concentrate on the silence between the small explosions of the axe striking the wood. He sucked cold air into his smoke-blackened lungs. His heart pounded too hard from the effort. The muscles in his shoulders cramped. He felt like he might have a heart attack at any moment.<br><br> Barbie would revive him and kill him again with her bare hands, furious to be left with the kids and the mortgage and the Catholic school tuitions.<br><br> Theirs was a marriage in the way of many couples&#x2014;a partnership of paychecks that didn&#x2019;t stretch far enough, intimacy a thing of memory, the future a projected image at the far end of a treadmill that ran too fast.<br><br> Some days all he wanted was off.<br><br> They resented each other more days than not. His wife had ceased to think of him as a man. He was a paycheck, a roommate, a pain in the ass. He had sought validation elsewhere. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to get. Consequently, it didn&#x2019;t mean anything. And the spiral of his life went down and down. He didn&#x2019;t like what his marriage had become. He didn&#x2019;t like what he had become.<br><br> His grandmother had always warned him about purgatory. Hell&#x2019;s waiting room, she used to call it. Purgatory had become his life.<br><br> Sometimes he wondered if death could be so much worse.<br><br> <i>Swing, crack! Swing, crack!</i><br><br> <i>Crack! Crack!<br><br></i> The final two sounds seemed to come from far away, like an echo.<br><br> Ted Duffy was dead before he could wonder why.<br><br> The first bullet hit him between the shoulder blades as he held the axe high over his head. It shattered bone and deflated a lung, tearing through a major artery. The second bullet struck him in the head, entering above the right ear, exiting below the left eye.<br><br>He dropped face-first to the ground at the base of the tree stump, his eyes open but seeing nothing, blood pooling beneath his cheek and seeping into the new-fallen snow.<br><b>2</b><br>November<br> Present Day<br> Minneapolis, MN<br><br> &#x201c;Duffy was a great guy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not one of the criteria for picking a cold case,&#x201d; Nikki Liska argued.<br><br> Gene Grider narrowed his eyes. He had a face like a bulldog, and breath to match. &#x201c;What the hell is wrong with you? Do you need a Midol or something?&#x201d;<br><br> She wrinkled her nose at him. &#x201c;What decade did you crawl up out of, Grider? Smells like 1955.&#x201d;<br><br> Grider had worked Homicide before her time, but not that long before her time. He had put in thirty years, doing stints in Homicide, Robbery, and Sex Crimes. His last few years on the job had been spent working special community initiatives&#x2014;jobs Nikki would have thought required a lot more charm than Grider could scrape together on his best day.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s twenty-five years since Duff was gunned down,&#x201d; he said, slamming his hand down on the table. &#x201c;Twenty-five years this month! It&#x2019;s a disgrace that this case has never been solved. This is what I&#x2019;m coming out of retirement for. We&#x2019;re finally getting a dedicated cold case unit. This case should be front and center!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like nobody&#x2019;s worked the case,&#x201d; Liska said. &#x201c;People have worked the case all along.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;On the side, with no money,&#x201d; Grider complained.<br><br> Which was exactly how the majority of cold cases were worked all over the country&#x2014;piecemeal, if at all. Cold case units were far more common on television than in reality. In the real world, police departments operated on taxpayer dollars, funding that was continually being cut to the bone. Homicide detectives all had their old unsolved cases that they continued to chip away at when they could, and passed them on to other detectives when they transferred or retired. It was a wonder any of them got solved, considering.<br><br> &#x201c;The same as all of these cases,&#x201d; Nikki pointed out.<br><br> She had spent the last two months going half blind reviewing cold cases dating back to the mid-seventies. Of the two hundred cases she had evaluated, she had pulled sixty seven for the final round of reviews. Grider had looked through another two hundred and pulled fifty nine. They had whittled the list down to a hundred, and now had to prioritize. They would be lucky if the federal grant money being used to set up the unit got them through half the cases on their short list.<br><br> &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t the same thing,&#x201d; Grider snapped. &#x201c;Duff was one of us. Where the hell is your loyalty?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t about loyalty,&#x201d; Liska said. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t matter that Duffy was a cop&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nice to know what you think of your peers,&#x201d; Grider sneered.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, get off your high horse,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about solvability. We&#x2019;ve got a limited budget. We have to go after the cases we have a hope in hell of closing. You couldn&#x2019;t close Duffy&#x2019;s case in twenty-five years for a reason&#x2014;there&#x2019;s jack shit to go on. He was shot from a distance. There were no witnesses, no fingerprints, no DNA, no trace evidence of any value,&#x201d; she said, ticking the points off on her fingers.<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to spend money and man hours going back over a case not likely to ever be solved?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;What case doesn&#x2019;t make the cut because we&#x2019;re giving priority to an unsolvable crime? The serial rapes from 1997? The child murder from 1985? The hit-and-run death of a father of six? Which one do we leave out? All of those cases have forensic evidence that can be retested with better technology than before. All of them are potentially solvable.&#x201d;<br><br> The new Homicide lieutenant, Joan Mascherino, looked from Liska to Grider and back like an impassive tennis umpire.<br><br> She was a neat and proper woman with auburn hair cut in a neat and proper style. Perfectly polished in her conservative gray suit and pearl earrings, she was Liska&#x2019;s height&#x2014;short. Kindred spirits in the world of the vertically challenged&#x2014;or so Nikki hoped.<br><br>She had learned long ago to take any advantage she could get in this profession still dominated by men. She certainly wasn&#x2019;t above playing the girls-gotta-stick-together card when she could do it subtly. But Joan Mascherino hadn&#x2019;t gotten where she was by being a pushover. In her mid-fifties, she had come on the job when discrimination against women was a way of life, and still worked her way up the ranks to lieutenant. Running Homicide was just another feather in her cap on her way to bigger things. Rumor had it she would be on her way upstairs to rub elbows with the deputy chiefs in the not-too-distant future.<br><br> Homicide&#x2019;s last boss, Kasselmann, had used the closing of the Doc Holiday murders as a springboard to being named Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau&#x2014;as if he&#x2019;d had anything to do with solving the serial killer&#x2019;s crimes. He just happened to be sitting in the office at the time.<br><br> Mascherino had come over from Internal Affairs just in time to be handed the plum of putting together the cold case unit, which would&#x2014;initially, at least&#x2014;be high profile and put her in the media spotlight.<br><br> Gene Grider, retired for eighteen months, had come back to work this unit, offering himself at part-time pay, which made him very attractive to the number crunchers trying to squeeze every penny out of the grant money. But it also augmented Grider&#x2019;s pension, and allowed him to bring his own agenda along with him. His agenda was Ted Duffy.<br><br>And so went the law enforcement food chain.<br><br> Nikki had her own agenda too. She had leveraged her role in closing the Doc Holiday cases to get Kasselmann to recommend her to this unit. When she caught a case in Homicide, it wasn&#x2019;t unusual to be on for twenty-four hours or more, straight. In Cold Case, there was no urgency. There were regular hours, giving her more time with her boys.<br><br> She had spent the better part of a decade in Homicide. The unit was her home away from home, her family away from family. She loved the job, was very good at the job. But RJ and Kyle, at fourteen and sixteen, were growing into young men, struggling through the pitfalls of adolescence as they made the transition from boyhood to independence and maturity. They needed an adult available, and she was it.

Do It!: My Half-Century Creating Disney&#39;s Magic Kingdoms (Disney Editions Deluxe)</h2><p><br>Marty Sklar was hired by The Walt Disney Company after his junior year at UCLA, and began his Disney career at Disneyland in July 1955, the month before the park opened. He spent his first decade at Disney as "the kid," the very youngest of the creative team Walt had assembled at WED Enterprises. But despite his youth, his talents propelled him forward into substantial responsibility: he became Walt's speech writer, penned Walt's and Roy's messages in the company's annual report, composed most of the publicity and marketing materials for Disneyland, conceived presentations for the U.S. government, devised initiatives to obtain sponsors to enable new Disneyland developments, and wrote a twenty-four-minute film expressing Walt's philosophy for the Walt Disney World project and Epcot. He was Walt's literary right-hand man.<br><br>Over the next forty years, Marty Sklar rose to become president and principal creative executive of Walt Disney Imagineering, and he devoted his entire career to creating, enhancing, and expanding Walt's magical empire.

After the crash of 2008 and the Great Recession, America got the weakest recovery in a century. The problem is that the Republicans are just as clueless as their opponents. The GOP can't win the debate--and the election--with the same old shtick. <p></p>George Gilder, who revolutionized free-market thinking with his bestselling <i>Wealth and Poverty</i>, does it again with <i>The Scandal of Money</i>. Worn-out doctrines of monetary manipulation are smothering innovation, bloating the financial sector, and crushing the middle class. <p></p>Gilder's great insight is that the economy is an information system, driven by human creativity. That system depends on a reliable measuring stick of value, which we call "money." If that measuring stick becomes variable (like the post-gold standard dollar), then information does not flow efficiently and creativity withers. <p></p>Our misplaced faith in the power of the Federal Reserve to conjure economic growth by manipulating the money supply has led to the capture of Wall Street by Washington and the consequent starvation of Main Street and Silicon Valley. <p></p>If we are to restore American prosperity, if the Republican Party--the party of free markets--is going to make a winning argument, we need to understand how money really works. The <i>Scandal of Money</i> is the most profound--and practical--analysis of politics and economics since Gilder's own classic <i>Wealth and Poverty</i>.<br>George Gilder, editor in chief of Gilder Technology Report, is chairman of Gilder Publishing LLC, located in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

Acclaimed nature writer April Pulley Sayre's lyrical text, paired with Steve Jenkins's stunning art, offers a glimpse into this fascinating world.</p><p>Discover different kinds of squirrels as the scamper, eat, and&#x2015;finally&#x2015;sleep.</p></p><p><p><b>April Pulley Sayre </b>and <b>Steve Jenkins </b>have collaborated on these highly praised books: <i>Vulture View</i>, <i>Eat Like a Bear</i>, and <i>Woodpecker Wham!</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>April is the author of more than sixty books for young readers, including <i>Honk, Honk, Goose!</i>, <i>Raindrops Roll</i>, and <i>Here Come the Humpbacks! </i>She lives in Indiana with her husband and a yard full of squirrels.</p><p>Steve has illustrated many celebrated books, including the Caldecott Honor book <i>What Do You Do With a Tail Like This?</i>, which he created with his wife, Robin Page. They live in Boulder, Colorado, with their three children.</p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Sayre introduces four types of squirrels in this rhyming nonfiction picture book. The gray squirrel, the fox squirrel, the red squirrel, and the flying squirrel zigzag across the branches and the book's pages. "Nose for sniffing./Jaws to chew./Eyes for looking/back at you." The pictures illustrate the creatures exploring their world, sniffing at flowers, chomping on acorns or seeds, and pausing at the creek to drink. Squirrels can hide under their tails, using them as umbrellas, when it rains. They also use their tails for balance or even as a flag. They have "paws for climbing./Paws to pick./Paws for cleaning./Paws run. Quick!" While there is a smattering of information in the main text, the bulk of facts are located in the back matter. Topics there include "Tails as Tools," "Early Life," "Feeding Times," and "Squirrels: The Planters." Children doing reports will learn about what the rodents eat, where they live, what scientific family and order they belong to, and how they contribute to the ecosystem. Jenkins's artwork is done with ink and cut- and torn-paper collage, produced in such a way that the pictures appear realistic and almost totally hand-drawn. Each page has merely four lines of text or so, with the rest of the layout reserved for the brilliant artwork.

She reveals how decision makers draw from ideas about talent&#x2015;what it is, what best signals it, and who does (and does not) have it&#x2015;that are deeply rooted in social class. Displaying the "right stuff" that elite employers are looking for entails considerable amounts of economic, social, and cultural resources on the part of the applicants and their parents.</p><p>Challenging our most cherished beliefs about college as a great equalizer and the job market as a level playing field, <i>Pedigree</i> exposes the class biases built into American notions about the best and the brightest, and shows how social status plays a significant role in determining who reaches the top of the economic ladder.</p></p><p><p>"In this riveting account of how the nation's top investment banks, consultancies, and law firms choose employees, Lauren Rivera goes inside the recruitment process, interviewing the interviewers and sitting in on their decision meetings.

More Than a Game: Revised Edition</h2><p><b>Master the fascinating game of Go with this expert guidebook.</b><br><br>Go is a two-player board game that first originated in ancient China but is also very popular in Japan and Korea. There is significant strategy and philosophy involved in the game, and the number of possible games is vast&#x2014;even when compared to chess. <br><br>Go has enthralled hundreds of millions of people in Asia, where it is an integral part of the culture. In the West, many have learned of its pleasures, especially after the game appeared in a number of hit movies, TV series, and books, and was included on major Internet game sites. By eliciting the highest powers of rational thought, the game draws players, not just for the thrills of competition, but because they feel it enhances their mental, artistic, and even spiritual lives.<br><br><i>Go! More Than a Game</i> is the guidebook that uses the most modern methods of teaching to learn Go, so that, in a few minutes, anyone can understand the two basic rules that generate the game.

But that isn&#x2019;t a testament to you. It&#x2019;s a testament to the God who created you. The problem? Few people discover the God-given identity that makes them unlike anyone else. Mark Batterson calls this divine distinction our <i>soulprint.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><b>God would like to introduce you to yourself.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Soulprint, </i>Mark pours the contagious energy he&#x2019;s known for into helping you experience the joy of discovering who you <i>are...</i>and the freedom of discovering who you&#x2019;re<i> not. </i>The wonderful fact is that your uniqueness is God&#x2019;s gift to you, and it&#x2019;s also your gift to God.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A self-discovery book that puts God at the center rather than self, <i>Soulprint </i>encourages you to recognize and explore the five defining moments&nbsp;in your life that will determine your destiny. Along the way, you&#x2019;ll find that you&#x2019;re not just turning the pages of a book. You&#x2019;re turning the pages of your remarkable, God-shaped, world-changing life.</p><p><b>Mark Batterson</b> serves as lead pastor of National Community Church (www.theaterchurch.com) in Washington, D.C.

It is in light of these overwhelming possibilities...that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people.You have never met a mere mortal.</i><br><b>&#x2014;C. S. Lewis , </b><i><b>The Weight of Glory</b><br></i>There has never been and never will be anyone else like you. But that isn&#x2019;t a testament to you. It&#x2019;s a testament to the God who created you. You are unlike anyone who has ever lived. But that uniqueness isn&#x2019;t a virtue. It&#x2019;s a responsibility. Uniqueness is God&#x2019;s gift to you, and uniqueness is your gift to God. You owe it to yourself to be yourself. But more important, you owe it to the One who designed you and destined you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake, this is no self-help book. Self-help is nothing more than idolatry dressed up in a rented tuxedo. So let me be blunt: you aren&#x2019;t good enough or gifted enough to get where God wants you to go. Not without His help. But here&#x2019;s the good news: there is nothing God cannot do in you and through you if you simply yield your life to Him. All of it. All of you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is all about you, but it&#x2019;s not about you at all. The fact that there never has been and never will be anyone like you simply means that no one can worship God like you or for you. <i>You were created to worship God in a way that no one else can.</i> How? By living a life no one else can&#x2014;your life. You have a unique destiny to fulfill, and no one can take your place. You play an irreplaceable role in God&#x2019;s grand narrative. But fulfilling your true destiny starts with discovering your true identity. And therein lies the challenge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us live our entire lives as strangers to ourselves. We know more about others than we know about ourselves. Our true identities get buried beneath the mistakes we&#x2019;ve made, the insecurities we&#x2019;ve acquired, and the lies we&#x2019;ve believed. We&#x2019;re held captive by others&#x2019; expectations. We&#x2019;re uncomfortable in our own skins. And we spend far too much emotional, relational, and spiritual energy trying to be who we&#x2019;re not. Why? Because it&#x2019;s easier. And we think it&#x2019;s safer. But trying to be who we&#x2019;re not amounts to forfeiting our spiritual birthrights. It&#x2019;s not just that we&#x2019;re lying to ourselves. Somewhere along the way, we lose ourselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;m not sure where you&#x2019;re at in your journey of self-discovery. Maybe you&#x2019;re on the front end, trying to figure out who you are. Maybe you&#x2019;re on the back end, trying to remember who you were meant to be. Or maybe you&#x2019;re somewhere in between, trying to close the gap between who you are and who you want to be. No matter where you are, I want you to experience the joy of discovering <i>who you are</i> and the freedom of discovering <i>who you&#x2019;re not. </i>It won&#x2019;t be easy. And there are no shortcuts. But if you are breathing, God hasn&#x2019;t given up on you yet. So don&#x2019;t give up on yourself. Let this promise soak into your spirit, because it will energize your reading: <i>it&#x2019;s never too late to be who you might have been.<br></i><br><b>SECOND PERSONA</b><br><br>Self-discovery is a lot like an archaeological dig. It takes a long time to uncover the hidden treasures that lie buried beneath the surface. You can never be certain of what you will find or where you will find it. And it is a painstaking process. But the failure to dig deep will result in a superficial life. If you live as a stranger to yourself, how can you find intimacy with others? Intimacy is a function of self-discovery. It&#x2019;s hard to truly get to know others if you don&#x2019;t even know yourself. And beyond the relational ramifications, there are occupational implications. If you haven&#x2019;t discovered your unique gifts and passions, how can you find fulfillment in what you do? You might make a living, but you won&#x2019;t make a life. You&#x2019;ll never experience the joy of doing what you love and loving what you do. And, finally, it&#x2019;s the spiritual side effects of superficiality that are the most detrimental. Superficiality is a form of hypocrisy. If you fail to discover the truth, the whole truth, about yourself, aren&#x2019;t you lying to yourself? Your life becomes a half truth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in a city, Washington DC, where image is everything. Meg Greenfield, who spent thirty years covering the city as a journalist with the <i>Washington Post,</i> likened it to high school. She referred to high school as a &#x201c;preeminently nervous&#x201d; place, and she believed that Washington was even worse. &#x201c;High school is the time when people first contrive to have an image,&#x201d; observed Greenfield. &#x201c;It is an attempt to fabricate a whole second persona for public consumption.&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s that second persona that results in a secondhand life. Instead of narrating our own lines in the first person, we live second-person lives by allowing others to narrate our lives for us. And that is hypocrisy at its worst. Our lives become lies. We not only cheat ourselves and others&#x2014;when we fail to discover our true God-given identities and God-ordained destinies, we also cheat the Third Person. Greenfield wrote:<br><i><br>Life inside the image...requires continuous care, feeding, and, above all, protection. That is the worst of it.... It&#x2019;s like never being able to get undressed....<br><br>We are, most of us, much of the time, in disguise. We present ourselves as we think we are meant to be. In Washington, this is greatly in excess of the ordinary hypocrisies...that exist everywhere else.1<br></i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish this were true only in Washington, but it&#x2019;s everywhere. In fact, superficiality is the curse of our culture. And the primary reason we live as strangers to ourselves is because we&#x2019;re afraid of what we&#x2019;ll find if we start digging. We don&#x2019;t really want to see ourselves for who we are. But if we can dig deeper than our fallen natures, we&#x2019;ll find the truth that lies buried beneath our sin: the image of God. We&#x2019;ll find our true identities. And our true destinies as well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pages that follow, we&#x2019;ll dig into your past, looking for clues to your future. We&#x2019;ll dust off the lies you&#x2019;ve believed and insecurities you&#x2019;ve acquired until your true identity is unveiled. And we&#x2019;ll make discoveries, both painful and pleasurable, that will forever change the way you see yourself. In fact, you&#x2019;ll never see yourself the same way, because you&#x2019;ll see yourself through the eyes of your Creator.<br><br><b>DESTINY CLUES<br></b><br>Time may be measured in minutes, but life is measured in moments. And some moments are larger than life. And it&#x2019;s those defining moments that dictate the way we see life. Some of them are as predictable as a wedding day or the birth of a child. Others are as unpredictable as an accident. You never know which moment might become a defining moment, but identifying those moments is the key to identifying who you are.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological research suggests that one&#x2019;s self-concept is defined by a very small number of experiences. Ninety-nine percent of life&#x2019;s experiences vanish like vapor into the subconscious abyss. Only one percent make it into our conscious memories. And less than one percent of that one percent are not just memorable but truly unforgettable. Those are the moments that define us. And managing those memories is a form of stewardship. Every past experience is preparation for some future opportunity. And one way God redeems the past is by helping us see it through His eyes, His providence. So the key to fulfilling your future destiny is hidden in your past memories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look in the mirror, what we see is a reflection of our accumulated experiences. And defining moments are like defining features. In a sense, we are an aggregation of where we&#x2019;ve been, what we&#x2019;ve done, and who we&#x2019;ve known. But there are a few places, a few experiences, and a few people that leave their imprints in ways that become parts of our soulprints.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly what, you may be wondering, is a soulprint? Think of it this way: Your fingerprint uniquely identifies you and differentiates you from everyone else who has ever lived, but your fingerprint is only skin deep. You possess a uniqueness that is soul deep. I call it your soulprint. It&#x2019;s not just who you are, present tense. It&#x2019;s who you are destined to become, future tense. It&#x2019;s not just who others see when they look at you from the outside in. It&#x2019;s who God has destined you to become from the inside out. Not unlike your genetic code that programs your physical anatomy, your soulprint hardwires your true identity and true destiny. So while you live your life forward, God works backward. The Omniscient One always starts with the end in mind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best example of how God uses defining moments to reveal a person&#x2019;s destiny is found in the life of David. He wrote,<br><br><i>All the days ordained for me<br>were written in your book<br>before one of them came to be.2<br></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the psalmist, all of your days are ordained by God. And it&#x2019;s your holy responsibility to discover that God-ordained destiny, just like David did. His epitaph speaks for itself:<br><br><i>When David had served God&#x2019;s purpose in his own<br>generation, he fell asleep.3<br></i><br>Despite humble beginnings and huge mistakes, David fulfilled his destiny. And that&#x2019;s why David&#x2019;s life is the backdrop for this book. He is the soulprint prototype. The defining moments or scenes in his life double as destiny clues that will help you serve ...</p></p><h2>Acupressure for Horses: Hands-On Techniques to Solve Performance Problems and Ease Pain and Discomfort</h2><p>Now you can help your horse with simple acupressure techniques!

Living in the presence of God she has found unconditional love and acceptance, healing for crippled emotions, contentment that overcomes depression, peace in the midst of adverse circumstances and grace for developing healthy relationships. The ongoing process of transformation evolved into praying for others, and the prayer of intercession became her prayer focus. Germaine is the daughter of the late Reverend A.H. &#x201c;Buck&#x201d; and Donnis Brock Griffin. She and her husband, Everette, have four children, and their prayer assignments increase as grandchildren and great-grandchildren are born.

In 1867, Winnie Tucker and her mother arrive in Cisco, California, where hundreds of Chinese workers are massed to dig the Summit Tunnel through the Sierra Nevada mountains. The two look forward to spending the summer with Winnie's father, a mining engineer for the Central Pacific Railroad, who is helping to supervise the work. Winnie befriends Lee Cheng, and their brief meetings give her the Chinese viewpoint on a strike and an explosion that traps her father and his brother inside the tunnel. Though Winnie is an artist in the middle of spectacular scenery, the flat, sometimes choppy, prose conveys little sense of setting. Since the characters sound more like vehicles to impart information than living, breathing human beings, they are not particularly engaging, nor do the incidents of discrimination touch the heart. Judith Eichler Weber's Forbidden Friendship (Silver Moon, 1993), set in a Massachussets factory town in the 1870s, invests more emotion in the costs and ambiguities of an interracial friendship during a strike. Laurence Yep's Dragon's Gate (HarperCollins, 1993) offers older readers a compelling picture of the 1867 strike. Still, libraries with a strong need for easy reading on the Chinese immigrant experience may want to consider Krensky's book.<br><i>Margaret A.

But here, too, are scientists, writers, radicals, sports figures, and religious leaders, with incisive portraits of such varied individuals as Thomas Edison and Eli Whitney, Babe Ruth and Muhammed Ali, Black Elk and Crazy Horse, Margaret Fuller, Emma Goldman, and Marian Anderson, even Al Capone and Jesse James. The <em>Companion</em> illuminates events that have shaped the nation (the Great Awakening, Bunker Hill, Wounded Knee, the Vietnam War); major Supreme Court decisions (<em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade</em>); landmark legislation (the Fugitive Slave Law, the Pure Food and Drug Act); social movements (Suffrage, Civil Rights); influential books (<em>The Jungle, Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>); ideologies (conservatism, liberalism, Social Darwinism); even natural disasters and iconic sites (the Chicago Fire, the Johnstown Flood, Niagara Falls, the Lincoln Memorial). Here too is the nation's social and cultural history, from Films, Football, and the 4-H Club, to Immigration, Courtship and Dating, Marriage and Divorce, and Death and Dying.

But in <em>The Music of Life</em>, world renowned physiologist Denis Noble argues that, to truly understand life, we must look beyond the "selfish gene" to consider life on a much wider variety of levels.<br> Life, Noble asserts, is a kind of music, a symphonic interplay between genes, cells, organs, body, and environment. He weaves this musical metaphor throughout this personal and deeply lyrical work, illuminating ideas that might otherwise be daunting to non-scientists. In elegant prose, Noble sets out a cutting-edge alternative to the gene's eye view, offering a radical switch of perception in which genes are seen as prisoners and the organism itself is a complex system of many interacting levels. In his more expansive view, life emerges as a process, the ebb and flow of activity in an intricate web of connections. He introduces readers to the realm of systems biology, a field that has been growing in strength in the past decade. Noble, himself one of the founders of this field, argues modern systems biology may be the view we need to adopt to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of life.<br> Drawing on his experiences in his research on the heartbeat, and on evolutionary biology, development, medicine, philosophy, linguistics, and Chinese culture, Noble presents us with a profound and very modern reflection on the nature of life. <br><br></p><p><br><strong>Denis Noble</strong> is Emeritus Professor of Cardiovascular Physiology at the University of Oxford.

It is about how to help people learn better. <br> <br> This volume provides a concise summary of a broad sampling of new methods of instruction currently under development, helps show the interrelationships among these diverse theories, and highlights current issues and trends in instructional design. It is a sequel to <i>Instructional-Design Theories and Models: An Overview of Their Current Status</i>, which provided a "snapshot in time" of the status of instructional theory in the early 1980s. Dramatic changes in the nature of instructional theory have occurred since then, partly in response to advances in knowledge about the human brain and learning theory, partly due to shifts in educational philosophies and beliefs, and partly in response to advances in information technologies. These changes have made new methods of instruction not only possible, but also necessary in order to take advantage of new instructional capabilities offered by the new technologies. These changes are so dramatic that many argue they constitute a new paradigm of instruction, which requires a new paradigm of instructional theory. <br> <br> In short, there is a clear need for this Volume II of <i>Instructional Design Theories and Models</i>. To attain the broad sampling of methods and theories it presents, and to make this book more useful for practitioners as well as graduate students interested in education and training, this volume contains twice as many chapters, but each half as long as the ones in Volume I, and the descriptions are generally less technical. Several unique features are provided by the editor to help readers understand and compare the theories in this book: <br> <br> *Chapter 1, which discusses the characteristics of instructional theory and the nature of the new paradigm of instruction, helps the reader identify commonalities across the theories. <br> *Chapter forewords, which summarize the major elements of the instructional-design theories, are useful for reviewing and comparing theories, as well as for previewing a theory to decide if it is of interest, and for developing a general schema that will make it easier to understand. <br> *Editor's notes provide additional help in understanding and comparing the theories and the new paradigm of instruction to which they belong. <br> *Units 2 and 4 have introductory chapters to help readers analyze and understand the theories in those units. <br> <br> This is an essential book for anyone interested in exploring new approaches to fostering human learning and development and thinking creatively about ways to best meet the needs of learners in all kinds of learning contexts. <br> <br> Readers are invited to use Dr. Charles Reigeluth's Web site to comment and to view others' comments about the instructional design theories in this book, as well as other theories.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

What we see as the mind's trickery, George Vaillant tells us, is actually healthy. What's more, it can reveal the mind at its most creative and mature, soothing and protecting us in the face of unbearable reality, managing the unmanageable, ordering disorder. And because creativity is so intrinsic to this alchemy of the ego, Vaillant mingles his studies of obscure lives with psychobiographies of famous artists and others--including Florence Nightingale, Sylvia Plath, Anna Freud, and Eugene O'Neill.</p><p>George E. Vaillant is Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.&#x201c;The rumor of the death of Ego Psychology is greatly exaggerated. As long as George Vaillant writes his engaging books extolling the wisdom of ego psychology it is destined to remain part of our theoretical landscape...<i>The Wisdom of the Ego</i> is written with the author's vivid, sometimes witty and consistently clear style, happily interspersed with numerous examples both from his longitudinal studies, as well as from biographies of well-known people...One need not agree with all of Vaillant's premises to appreciate and enjoy this colorful and many-faceted book. I cannot think of a better, more absorbing book to introduce clinical graduate students and clinicians in general to an up-dated version of the best ideas of ego psychology.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sophie Freud</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Journal of Psychotherapy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a remarkable synthesis of the best current thinking on ego psychology as well as a many-faceted picture of what Robert White would call 'lives in progress.' It makes on its own not only a highly innovative contribution to ego psychology but an equally original and impressive contribution to longitudinal research. A remarkable and many-faceted work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George W. Goethals, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Vaillant tells us that ego defenses are not pathological formations or symptoms of mental illness. They are ingenious self-deceptions that serve adaptation...He is to be commended for bringing certain unconscious processes into focus and for illuminating the various ways in which ego defenses contribute to a person's adaptation to life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Louise J. Kaplan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Sunday Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The thesis of <i>The Wisdom of the Ego</i> is most persuasively developed by the use of life histories, some of which derive from subjects in Vaillant's study groups but many of which are derived from life histories of famous individuals. The reader gets delicious insights into the way that life experiences shaped the ego's defensive repertoire and how these defenses then shaped the careers of characters as diverse as Beethoven and Emily Dickinson, Tolstoy and Henry Ford, and Gandhi and Josef Mengele...The illustrations offered by these famous lives result in a book that is entertaining and memorable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John G.

Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captured the imagination of all.<br>Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 1930s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, even if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, its own author, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships.</p> <p>C.K. Ogden's translation of the <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> has a unique provenance. As revealed in <em>Letters of C.K. Ogden</em> (1973) and in correspondence in <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>, Wittgenstein, Ramsey and Moore all worked with Ogden on the translation, which had Wittgenstein's complete approval.</p></p><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 - 1951) is regarded by many as the most outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century.Text: English, German (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages: An Introduction</h2><p><p>David Nunan&#x2019;s dynamic learner-centered teaching style has informed and inspired countless TESOL educators around the world. In this fresh, straightforward introduction to teaching English to speakers of other languages he presents teaching techniques and procedures along with the underlying theory and principles. </p> <p>Complex theories and research studies are explained in a clear and comprehensible, yet non-trivial, manner without trivializing them. Practical examples of how to develop teaching materials and tasks from sound principles provide rich illustrations of theoretical constructs. The content is presented through a lively variety of different textual genres including classroom vignettes showing language teaching in action, question and answer sessions, and opportunities to &#x2018;eavesdrop&#x2019; on small group discussions among teachers and teachers in preparation. Readers get involved through engaging, interactive pedagogical features and opportunities for reflection and personal application. Each chapter follows the same format so that readers know what to expect as they work through the text. Key terms are defined in a Glossary at the end of the book. David Nunan&#x2019;s own reflections and commentaries throughout enrich the direct, up-close style of the text.</p></p><p><p><strong>David Nunan</strong> is President Emeritus at Anaheim University in California and Professor Emeritus in Applied Linguistics at the University of Hong Kong.

Comprising a range of voices from both within and outside the academy, this collection draws from traditional feminisms, postmodern feminism, queer theory, and sex radicalism. It stretches the boundaries of contemporary feminism, holding accountable both traditional feminism for stigmatizing sex workers, and also the sex industry for its sexist practices.</p><p>Strippers, peepshow dancers, and porn stars trade spiked heels for footnotes while demonstrating their often overlooked ability to engage in scholarly discourse in this collection of essays focusing on the subject of feminism as practiced by those who call themselves &#34;sex workers.&#34; Along with the first-person accounts by such underground luminaries as Nina Hartley, Tracy Quan, and Annie Sprinkle, are forays into the sex dens by a number of academics. The writing is frank, though hardly pornographic, and many of the points raised and discussed are treated with more seriousness and considerably more insight than they usually are in the mainstream press."This book is provocative.

Beginning in 1938 and continuing through the 1950s, Dr. Murray used sea solids - mineral salts remaining after water is evaporated from ocean water - as fertilizer on a variety of vegetables, fruits and grains. His extensive experiments demonstrated repeatedly and conclusively that plants fertilized with sea solids and animals fed sea-solid-fertilized feeds grow stronger and more resistant to disease. <p><i>Sea Energy Agriculture</i> recounts Murray's experiments and presents his astounding conclusions. The work of this eco-pioneer was largely ignored during his lifetime, and his book became a lost classic - out-of-print for more than 25 years. Now this rare volume is once again available, with a new foreward and afterword by the founder of Acres U.S.A., Charles Walters.</p></p><p>Born in 1910, Dr. Maynard Murray recieved his bachelor of science degree in 1934 and graduated from the University of Cincinnati Medical School in 1936. Two additional years of post graduate study in internal medicine followed, then an additional three and one-half years for his specialty, ear, nose and throat. <p>With a voracious appetite for learning, Dr. Murray taught physiology and directed a number of experiments at the University of Cincinnati between 1937 and 1947. Meanwhile he attended night school to study law and trained in medical hypnosis under Dr. Mullenhoff. He was a member of the Association of Medical Hypnotism, the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association, Chicago Medical Society and the Illinois State Medical Society. </p><p>In 1947 he moved to Chicago and established a private practice. For the following 25 years, Dr. Murray practiced his specialty, carried on extensive experimentation in sea solid fertilization, and authored at least 20 articles, which appeared in national and international medical journals. </p><p>He later lived in Ft. Myers, Florida, where he was Medical Director at Sunland Center. While in Florida he was engaged in commercial hydroponic tomato farming using his patented sea solid technology.

The premise of this volume is that he most certainly does. Approaching Freud from not only the philosophical but also historical, psychoanalytical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives, the contributors show us how Freud gave us a new and powerful way to think about human thought and action. They consider the context of Freud&#39;s thought and the structure of his arguments to reveal how he made sense of ranges of experience generally neglected or misunderstood. All the central topics of Freud&#39;s work from sexuality and neurosis to morality, art, and culture are covered.</p><p>The range of Freud&#39;s work, from sexuality and neurosis to morality, art and culture, is covered in contributions that reveal how he provided society with an original means of interpreting neglected or misunderstood experiences.Approaching Freud from not only the philosophical but also historical, psychoanalytical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives, the contributors show us how Freud gave us a new and powerful way to think about human thought and action.</p><h2>Collected Works of Oscar Wilde (Wordsworth Special Editions)</h2><p>Wilde&#39;s works are suffused with his aestheticism, brilliant craftsmanship, legendary wit and, ultimately, his tragic muse. He wrote tender fairy stories for children employing all his grace, artistry and wit, of which the best-known is The Happy Prince. Counterpoints to this were his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, which shocked and outraged many readers of his day, and his stories for adults which exhibited his fascination with the relations between serene art and decadent life. Wilde took London by storm with his plays, particularly his masterpiece The Importance of Being Earnest. His essays - in particular De Profundis- and his Ballad of Reading Gaol, both written after his release from prison, strikingly break the bounds of his usual expressive range. His other essays and poems are all included in this comprehensive collection of the works of one of the most exciting writers of the late nineteenth century.</p><p>Born in Ireland in 1856, Oscar Wilde was a noted essayist, playwright, fairy tale writer and poet, as well as an early leader of the Aesthetic Movement. His plays include: <i>An Ideal Husband, Salome, A Woman of No Importance,</i> and <i>Lady Windermere's Fan.</i> Among his best known stories are <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> and <i>The Canterville Ghost</i>.<p>Chapter One</p><p><b>The Picture Of Dorian Gray</b></p><p>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</p><p>From the corner of the divan of' Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.</p><p>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.</p><p>As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.</p><p>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry, languidly. " You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place."</p><p>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. " No : I won't send it anywhere."</p><p>Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such </p><p>fanciful whirls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette. " Not send it anywhere ? My dear fellow, why ? Have you any reason ? What odd chaps you painters are ! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion."</p><p>"I know you will laugh at me," he replied, " but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."</p><p>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.</p><p>"Yes, I knew you would ; but it is quite true, all the same."</p><p>"Too much of yourself in it ! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain ; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young</p><p>Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you-well, of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he a-ways looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless, beautiful creature, who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter yourself, Basil : you are not in the least like him."</p><p>"You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist. " O course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders ? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.

Nearly 70 percent of young black men will be imprisoned at some point in their lives, and poor black men with low levels of education make up a disproportionate share of incarcerated Americans. In Invisible Men, sociologist Becky Pettit demonstrates another vexing fact of mass incarceration: most national surveys do not account for prison inmates, a fact that results in a misrepresentation of U.S. political, economic, and social conditions in general and black progress in particular. Invisible Men provides an eye-opening examination of how mass incarceration has concealed decades of racial inequality. Pettit marshals a wealth of evidence correlating the explosion in prison growth with the disappearance of millions of black men into the American penal system. She shows that, because prison inmates are not included in most survey data, statistics that seemed to indicate a narrowing black-white racial gap&#x2014;on educational attainment, work force participation, and earnings&#x2014;instead fail to capture persistent racial, economic, and social disadvantage among African Americans. Federal statistical agencies, including the U.S. Census Bureau, collect surprisingly little information about the incarcerated, and inmates are not included in household samples in national surveys. As a result, these men are invisible to most mainstream social institutions, lawmakers, and nearly all social science research that isn't directly related to crime or criminal justice. Since merely being counted poses such a challenge, inmates' lives&#x2014;including their family background, the communities they come from, or what happens to them after incarceration&#x2014;are even more rarely examined. And since correctional budgets provide primarily for housing and monitoring inmates, with little left over for job training or rehabilitation, a large population of young men are not only invisible to society while in prison but also ill-equipped to participate upon release. Invisible Men provides a vital reality check for social researchers, lawmakers, and anyone who cares about racial equality. The book shows that more than a half century after the first civil rights legislation, the dismal fact of mass incarceration inflicts widespread and enduring damage by undermining the fair allocation of public resources and political representation, by depriving the children of inmates of their parents' economic and emotional participation, and, ultimately, by concealing African American disadvantage from public view.</p></p><p>BECKY PETTIT is professor of sociology at the University of Washington.</p><h2>Everyday Mathematics 4, Grade 4, Student Math Journal 1</h2><p>Supports daily classroom instruction and gives students a long-term record of their mathematical progress and development.

Based upon archival and published sources, the work describes the events in the Bolshevik Party leading up to the Great Purges of 1937-1938. Professor Getty concludes that the party bureaucracy was chaotic rather than totalitarian, and that local officials had relative autonomy within a considerably fragmented political system. The Moscow leadership, of which Stalin was the most authoritarian actor, reacted to social and political processes as much as instigating them. Because of disputes, confusion, and inefficiency, they often promoted contradictory policies. Avoiding the usual concentration on Stalin&#39;s personality, the author puts forward the controversial hypothesis that the Great Purges occurred not as the end product of a careful Stalin plan, but rather as the bloody but ad hoc result of Moscow&#39;s incremental attempts to centralise political power.</p><p>This is a study of the structure of the Soviet Communist Party, from the events in the Bolshevik Party leading up to the Great Purges of 1937-1938.

Using archival and newspaper sources, he queries the image of a tightly-organized party, controlled from the centre by its omnipotent leader, Stalin. Instead we see a badly-organized, inefficient and faction-ridden institution, marked by indecision at the top and confusion at the bottom. Against this backgroun, Getty offers us a new and original explanation for the explosion of political violence and terror in the Yezhovshchina.

Now, with <em>The Scars of Evolution</em>, Morgan offers a pioneering look just where it was our earliest ancestors came from, and the legacy--not always advantageous--that they left us. As she sets out to solve one of the enduring riddles of our origins--to discover the evolutionary path that separated us from the rest of the animals--Morgan shows that many of the theories currently accepted by scientists cannot explain our unique features: they leave too many questions unanswered.<br>Millions of years ago, something happened to our ape ancestors that did not happen to the forebears of gorillas and chimpanzees, something that made them walk on two legs, lose their fur, sweat, develop larger brains, and learn to speak. While scientists have visited many a dig and studied many a fossil for clues, Elaine Morgan argues that all of the facts about our mysterious origins are right in front of us--in the form of fundamental flaws in the human design. Our propensity to suffer from lower back pain, obesity, varicose veins, acne, even infant death syndrome, is essentially the result of a cataclysmic event in our distant past.<br>Scientists have long observed that our spines were not made for upright walking. Yet natural selection--the basic tenet of evolutionary theory--dictates that enduring changes to a species occur because of the need to adapt to changes in the environment. While thousands of working hours are lost each year to "bad backs," at some point long ago it must have been an advantage to walk on two legs. The most common theory is that we became bipedal while hunting on the African savannah, needing our arms free for weapons, using an upright stance to see enemies from afar. But as Morgan points out, animals need more speed on the savannah, both for pursuit and flight, than two legs can offer. Her explanation: bipedalism emerged from life in an aquatic environment due to the flooding of the African rift valley millennia ago. The apes that suddenly found themselves stranded in swamp land (a swamp that remained for thousands of years) had to walk upright to keep from drowning. The human tendency toward obesity was once not an unsightly health problem, but rather a lifesaving form of insulation, one present in all aquatic mammals. And as Morgan carefully considers all of our other uniquely human traits--our relative hairlessness, our ability to control our breathing, our inability to maintain proper salt levels--a compelling case emerges for our human origins in a watery environment.<br>Lively, controversial, and presented with a brilliant logic, <em>The Scars of Evolution</em> will change the way you think about the world--and our place in it.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elaine Morgan</strong>'s first book, <em>The Descent of Woman</em> (1972), was an international bestseller in nine languages. Best known as an award-winning writer for television, she is also the author of <em>The Aquatic Ape</em> (1982).<br>"An exceptionally well-written book.

Simpson. And that's just a taste of the controversy and debate that Black English has provoked over the years. Called "Spoken Soul" by Claude Brown, author of <i>Manchild in the Promised Land</i>, the dialect of African Americans has been lauded, derided, questioned, and discussed for decades, but never so comprehensively and fairly as in this historic, sociologic, and linguistic overview and analysis by John Russell Rickford (the Martin Luther King Jr. Centennial Professor of Linguistics at Stanford University) and Russell John Rickford (a journalist, formerly of the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>).<p> They discuss the attitudinal impact of socioeconomic factors, as well as the effect of generation and gender. They look at the place of black vernacular in literature and family, identity and culture, education and politics. And they track previous debates, from Paul Laurence Dunbar's considerations in the late 1800s to the black intelligentsia of the Harlem Renaissance to the issues raised by the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the recent Ebonics discourse.</p><p> Part 2, entitled "This Passion, This Skill, This Incredible Music," takes a close look at the richness of Spoken Soul, as recorded in literature (both black and white), from John Leacock's 1776 play <i>The Fall of British Tyranny</i> to DMX's rap lyrics of today. They look at the language of preachers and comedians, actors and singers, and scores of writers, and then they delve deeper, into the components of the living language, examining the vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, and history of the black vernacular. And finally, the Rickfords discuss the role of Spoken Soul in terms of African American identity. The result? A thoughtful, erudite, and provocative narrative that lifts the discussion of Black English out of the knee-jerk negativity that arose from the Ebonics controversy of 1996 and into the loftier and more appropriate realms of linguistics, literature, and culture. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>"Rich and powerful&#x2014;and funky and bold&#x2014;dissects black writing and speech, its grammar and history, its controversy, and the media coverage of it. . . .

Along with updated media examples, expanded theories and analysis, this edition explores even more deeply the coverage of race in two chapters, discusses more broadly how men and boys are depicted in the media and socialized, and how class issues have become even more visible since the Great Recession of the 21st century and the Occupy movements. Special activities and exercises are provided in the book and an online Instructor&#39;s Manual is available to adopters.</p><p><p><strong>Linda Holtzman</strong>, Professor Emeritus at Webster University, has been a leader in media and diversity program development and teaching for 25 years.

As a result, conservatives' mobilizing efforts increasingly turned to law schools, professional networks, public interest groups, and the judiciary--areas traditionally controlled by liberals. Drawing from internal documents, as well as interviews with key conservative figures, <i>The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement</i> examines this sometimes fitful, and still only partially successful, conservative challenge to liberal domination of the law and American legal institutions.</p><br><p> Unlike accounts that depict the conservatives as fiendishly skilled, <i>The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement</i> reveals the formidable challenges that conservatives faced in competing with legal liberalism. Steven Teles explores how conservative mobilization was shaped by the legal profession, the legacy of the liberal movement, and the difficulties in matching strategic opportunities with effective organizational responses. He explains how foundations and groups promoting conservative ideas built a network designed to dislodge legal liberalism from American elite institutions. And he portrays the reality, not of a grand strategy masterfully pursued, but of individuals and political entrepreneurs learning from trial and error.</p><br><p> Using previously unavailable materials from the Olin Foundation, Federalist Society, Center for Individual Rights, Institute for Justice, and Law and Economics Center, <i>The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement</i> provides an unprecedented look at the inner life of the conservative movement. Lawyers, historians, sociologists, political scientists, and activists seeking to learn from the conservative experience in the law will find it compelling reading.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement</i> provides an essential road map to the organizational mobilization of conservatives over the past quarter century."<b>--Al Gore, corecipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize</b></p><p>"Steven Teles's deep, meticulous study of the successes and failures of the conservative legal reform movement illuminates the politics of law like nothing else in the literature. Combining original reporting, political theory, and institutional analysis in just the right proportions, his bold and deliberate investigation leads to a bracing conclusion: idealism, risk taking, patience, and devotion to the intrinsic merits of ideas are not secondary, but essential to the discovery of successful political strategies."<b>--Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research</b></p><p>"In this deeply informative and engagingly written book, Teles credits, as many academics refuse to do, the possibility that the success of the conservative legal movement is to be explained in part by the intellectual force of conservative arguments. His fair-mindedness is praiseworthy not only for its own sake, but also for enabling him to produce a more accurate and refined account of the remarkable phenomenon he seeks to understand."<b>--Robert P. George, Princeton University</b></p><p>"A timely and important book. Drawing on inside accounts from key players, Teles tells the remarkable story of how conservatives overthrew liberal legal assumptions; more importantly, he shows how successful ideas depend on building organizations, institutions, and networks to propagate and defend them."<b>--Jack M. Balkin, Yale Law School</b></p><p>"<i>The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement</i> is a terrific, pathbreaking book, and Teles tells the story with verve, clarity, and elegance. Through the quality of its argument and evidence, this book will become the standard authority on the conservative movement in law."<b>--Charles Epp, author of <i>The Rights Revolution: Lawyers, Activists, and Supreme Courts in Comparative Perspective</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement</i> is the rare ambitious book that succeeds in presenting both the theory and the details. It offers compelling arguments about entrenchment and countermobilization, organizational strategies and institutional maintenance. It provides vivid pictures of particular organizations, entrepreneurs, and controversies. And it tells instructive stories about failures as well as successes.

An extraordinary group of cognitive psychologists, curriculum specialists, teacher-educators, and researchers have developed a two-dimensional framework, focusing on knowledge and cognitive processes, that defines what students are expected to learn in school. A series of vignettes-written by and for teachers-illustrates how to use this unique framework. A revision only in the sense that it builds on the original framework, it is a completely new manuscript in both text and organization. Its two-dimensional framework interrelates knowledge with the cognitive processes students use to gain and work with knowledge. Together, these define the goals, curriculum standards, and objectives students are expected to learn. The framework facilitates the exploration of curriculums from four perspectives-what is intended to be taught, how it is to be taught, how learning is to be assessed, and how well the intended aims, instruction and assessments are aligned for effective education. This "revisited" framework allows you to connect learning from all these perspectives. This "Professional Edition" includes an additional section ("The Taxonomy in Perspective,") which is not available in the "Revisited for Teachers" edition of the book. </p></p><p>This revision of Bloom's taxonomy is designed to help teachers understand and implement standards-based curriculums.

The traditional explanations involving the struggle for sovereignty and the bourgeois revolution have been questioned in recent years. In this study, Conrad Russell offers a compelling new analysis, bringing into focus fundamental religious and constitutional issues of vital importance to contemporaries but neglected by historians. Drawing heavily on research in printed and unpublished sources, Russell highlights the constitutional problem of multiple kingdoms within Britain; the religious problem of competing theologies within and outside a state church; and the economic problem of the inadequacy of royal revenue to meet the needs of the monarchy. The most in-depth account to date of the origins of one of the most significant events in British history, this will be essential reading for all students of the seventeenth century.</p><p>Professor Russell highlights the constitutional problem of multiple kingdoms within Britain, the religious problem of competing theologies within two or three state churches, and the financial problem of the inadequacy of royal revenue to meet the needs of the monarchy.Conrad Russell is at King&#39;s College, London.</p><h2>The Invention of Autonomy: A History of Modern Moral Philosophy</h2><p>J.B. Schneewind&#39;s remarkable book is the most comprehensive study ever written of the history of moral philosophy. Its aim is to set Kant&#39;s still influential ethics in its historical context by showing in detail what the central questions in moral philosophy were for him and how he arrived at his own distinctive ethical views. In its range, analyses, and discussion of the subtle interweaving of religious and political thought with moral philosophy, this is an unprecedented account of the evolution of Kant&#39;s ethics.</p><p>At the beginning of <i>The Invention of Autonomy</i>, J.B. Schneewind modestly explains that he began work on the book "because there were many aspects of Kant's moral philosophy I could not understand," and he therefore sought to understand Kant's remarkable contribution to moral theory by considering it in its historical context. By the time one finishes reading the book, over 500 pages later, it's reasonable to question if there's anything about modern moral philosophy that Schneewind fails to understand. <p> <i>The Invention of Autonomy</i> is divided into four main parts. In the first part, Schneewind discusses the natural-law theory of morality, as classically expounded by St. Thomas Aquinas, and traces its rise and fall by considering the works of Luther, Calvin, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Charron, Suarez, Grotius, Hobbes, Cumberland, Pufendorf, Locke, and Thomasius. The second part deals with perfectionist approaches, as exemplified by Herbert of Cherbury, Descartes, the Cambridge Platonists, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Leibniz. The third part looks at moral philosophers who, by and large, are inclined to regard morality as independent of God's ongoing cooperation. Most of the canonical British moralists, from Shaftesbury, Clarke, and Mandeville to Hume, Reid, and Bentham, are included. Finally, in the fourth part, Schneewind examines anticipations of Kant's invention (or, perhaps, discovery) of autonomy in the works of Wolff, Crusius, the French <i>philosophes</i>, and Rousseau. He then skillfully relates Kant's moral thought to the rich tradition preceding it.</p><p> In comprehensiveness, authoritativeness, insightfulness, and accessibility, there is simply no work in English on the history of modern ethics that rivals <i>The Invention of Autonomy</i>. Nobody interested in moral philosophy or its history can afford to ignore it. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>Schneewind is Professor of Philosophy at the Johns Hopkins University.</p><h2>More Than Miracles: The State of the Art of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (Routledge Mental Health Classic Editions)</h2><p>The latest developments in this groundbreaking therapy approach! <br><br>More Than Miracles: The State of the Art of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy is a ground breaking, intellectually provocative book, revealing new advances in the widely used, evidence based Solution-focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) approach.

This is the argument of <i>Golden Rule</i>, a provocative, pungent history of modern American politics. Although the role big money plays in defining political outcomes has long been obvious to ordinary Americans, most pundits and scholars have virtually dismissed this assumption. Even in light of skyrocketing campaign costs, the belief that major financial interests primarily determine who parties nominate and where they stand on the issues&#x2014;that, in effect, Democrats and Republicans are merely the left and right wings of the "Property Party"&#x2014;has been ignored by most political scientists. Offering evidence ranging from the nineteenth century to the 1994 mid-term elections, <i>Golden Rule</i> shows that voters are "right on the money."<br> <br> Thomas Ferguson breaks completely with traditional voter centered accounts of party politics. In its place he outlines an "investment approach," in which powerful investors, not unorganized voters, dominate campaigns and elections. Because businesses "invest" in political parties and their candidates, changes in industrial structures&#x2014;between large firms and sectors&#x2014;can alter the agenda of party politics and the shape of public policy.<br> <br> <i>Golden Rule</i> presents revised versions of widely read essays in which Ferguson advanced and tested his theory, including his seminal study of the role played by capital intensive multinationals and international financiers in the New Deal. The chapter "Studies in Money Driven Politics" brings this aspect of American politics into better focus, along with other studies of Federal Reserve policy making and campaign finance in the 1936 election. Ferguson analyzes how a changing world economy and other social developments broke up the New Deal system in our own time, through careful studies of the 1988 and 1992 elections. The essay on 1992 contains an extended analysis of the emergence of the Clinton coalition and Ross Perot's dramatic independent insurgency. A postscript on the 1994 elections demonstrates the controlling impact of money on several key campaigns.<br> <br> This controversial work by a theorist of money and politics in the U.S. relates to issues in campaign finance reform, PACs, policymaking, public financing, and how today's elections work.</p></p><p>THOMAS FERGUSON is Dean of Bexley Hall, within the Bexley Hall Seabury Western Theological Federation.

In <em>From Disgust to Humanity</em>, Nussbaum aims her considerable intellectual firepower at the bulwark of opposition to gay equality: the politics of disgust.<br><br>Nussbaum argues that disgust has long been among the fundamental motivations of those who are fighting for legal discrimination against lesbian and gay citizens. When confronted with same-sex acts and relationships, she writes, they experience "a deep aversion akin to that inspired by bodily wastes, slimy insects, and spoiled food--and then cite that very reaction to justify a range of legal restrictions, from sodomy laws to bans on same-sex marriage." Leon Kass, former head of President Bush's President's Council on Bioethics, even argues that this repugnance has an inherent "wisdom," steering us away from destructive choices. Nussbaum believes that the politics of disgust must be confronted directly, for it contradicts the basic principle of the equality of all citizens under the law. "It says that the mere fact that you happen to make me want to vomit is reason enough for me to treat you as a social pariah, denying you some of your most basic entitlements as a citizen." In its place she offers a "politics of humanity," based not merely on respect, but something akin to love, an uplifting imaginative engagement with others, an active effort to see the world from their perspectives, as fellow human beings. Combining rigorous analysis of the leading constitutional cases with philosophical reflection about underlying concepts of privacy, respect, discrimination, and liberty, Nussbaum discusses issues ranging from non-discrimination and same-sex marriage to "public sex." Recent landmark decisions suggest that the views of state and federal courts are shifting toward a humanity-centered vision, and Nussbaum's powerful arguments will undoubtedly advance that cause.<br><br>Incisive, rigorous, and deeply humane, <em>From Disgust to Humanity</em> is a stunning contribution to Oxford's distinguished <em>Inalienable Rights </em>series.<br></p><p><br><strong>Martha Nussbaum</strong> is the Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, appointed in Law, Philosophy, and Divinity.

But for Mary Midgley it can never be the whole story, as it cannot truly explain what it means to be human. </p> <p>In this typically crusading work, universally acclaimed as a classic on first publication, she powerfully asserts her corrective view that without poetry (or literature, or music, or history, or even theology) we cannot hope to understand our humanity.&nbsp;In this&nbsp;remarkable book, the reader is struck by both the simplicity and power of her argument and the sheer pleasure of reading one of our most accessible philosophers.</p></p><p>Mary Midgley is a popular moral philosopher and has been described by The Guardian as &#34;the foremost scourge of scientific pretension in this country.&#34; She has recently completed her autobiography, The Owl of Minerva (Routledge, 2005).<p><strong>&#x2018;A fiercely combative philosopher ... our foremost scourge of scientific pretension.&#x2019;</strong>&nbsp;&#x2013; <em>The Guardian</em></p></p><h2>Pedophiles and Priests: Anatomy of a Contemporary Crisis</h2><p>This volume takes a close, dispassionate look at the entire history of the issue of sexual abuse among the clergy, and especially among the Roman Catholic clergy. From the first rumblings to today's headlines, Philip Jenkins has written a fascinating, exhaustive, and, above all, even-handed account that not only puts this particular crisis in perspective, but offers an eye-opening look at the way in which an issue takes hold of the popular imagination. Jenkins reassures us about our local clergy, but also delivers a disturbing message about how vulnerable we are to the news media. Meticulously documented and dispassionately argued, this volume marks a watershed in the discussion of an issue of enormous current interest, one that will not disappear from the headlines any time soon.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip Jenkins</strong>, one of the world's leading religion scholars joined Baylor University's Institute for Studies of Religion as Distinguished Professor of History and Co-Director for the Program on Historical Studies of Religion.<br>Since 1982, 400 Catholic clergy (out of a total of 50,000 American priests) have been accused of sexual misconduct with minors. In this in-depth study, Jenkins, professor of history and religious studies at Pennsylvania State University, examines the circumstances surrounding the molestation charges that peaked in the early 1990s. He looks at such prominent cases as those of Father Bruce Ritter, founder of Covenant House, who was forced to resign in disgrace in 1990; and the notorious Rev. James Porter, who may have molested more than 100 children before he was convicted and sentenced to prison. Jenkins probes scandals in other religions; looks at the traditional "anti-Catholic" feelings in the U.S.; documents the media's frenzied reactions to the charges; chronicles the feminist response to the allegations; and researches the financial drain on the Church caused by litigation (estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars) as well as the debate surrounding recovered memory and repressed memory. Jenkins (Intimate Enemies) has written a thorough, academic study that convincingly challenges the popular estimate of the extent of pedophiles in the Church. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A History of the Hellenistic World: 323 - 30 BC [Blackwell History of the Ancient World Ser.]</h2><p><i>A History of the Hellenistic World</i> provides an engaging look at the Macedonian monarchies in the period following the reign of Alexander the Great, and examines their impact on the Greek world. <ul> <li>Offers a clearly organized narrative with particular emphasis on state and governmental structures</li> <li>Makes extensive use of inscriptions in translation to illustrate the continuing vitality of the Greek city states prior to the Roman conquest</li> <li>Emphasizes the specific Macedonian origins of all active participants in the creation of the Hellenistic world</li> <li>Highlights the relationships between Greek city-states and Macedonian monarchies</li> </ul></p><p><i>A History of the Hellenistic World</i> provides a new, authoritative account of the period following the reign of Alexander the Great.

It opens with Hughes's hero Augustine in prohibition era America, where he is a bemused onlooker and an increasingly fascinated participant in a country intoxicated with sex, violence, and booze. In brilliant cinematic style, the book then moves to Germany, where the Nazi Party is gradually gaining in power; to the slums, mining towns, parliamentary back rooms, and great houses of a Britain teetering on the verge of class war; and to the wilds of the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The novel ends with a terrifying account of the Night of the Long Knives, as Hitler ruthlessly secures his hold upon Germany.<br><br>This new edition of the <i>The Wooden Shepherdess</i> concludes with the twelve chapters that Hughes completed of the planned third volume of "The Human Predicament," here published for the first time in America.</p><p>Richard Hughes (1900-1976) was born in Surrey, England, but his ancestors came from Wales and he considered himself a Welshman. After an early childhood marked by the deaths of two older siblings and his father (his mother then went to work as a magazine journalist), Hughes attended boarding school and, with every expectation of being sent to fight in the First World War, enrolled in the military. Armistice was declared, however, before he could see active service, and Hughes was free to go to Oxford, where he became a star on the university literary scene, with a book of poems in print and a play produced in the West End by the time he graduated in 1922. Hughes&#x2019;s first novel,&nbsp;<i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i>, came out in 1928 and was a best seller in the United Kingdom and America.&nbsp;<i>In Hazard</i>&nbsp;followed ten years later. Hughes also wrote stories for children and radio plays, but his final major undertaking was the &#x201c;The Human Predicament&#x201d;, an ambitious amalgamation of fact and fiction that would track the German and English branches of a single family into the disaster of the Second World War while offering a dramatic depiction of Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power. The work was planned as a trilogy, but remained incomplete at the time of Hughes&#x2019;s death. The first volume,&nbsp;<i>The Fox in the Attic</i>, appeared in 1960, to great critical acclaim; volume two,&nbsp;<i>The Wooden Shepherdess</i>, was published in 1973.

He was gripping the stem of a silver goblet, turning it slowly as he pondered.</p> <p>"Now that the snow is melting, Bari will be on the move," Gahan added. He spoke softly, not wanting to sound impatient, although he was.</p> <p>"That might be so," the earl said, "but you cannae convict a man before he acts. Thinking a thing does nae make a man guilty."</p> <p>"His sister tried to kill ye," Norris interrupted from where he sat on the other side of his father. "I agree with Gahan-Bari Fraser will use the spring to try and cause trouble."</p> <p>Gahan locked stares with his brother. Norris was his opposite, with blond hair and green eyes. He kept his chin scraped clean and stood over six feet. Gahan's own hair was dark as midnight and his eyes even blacker. They shared a father, though Gahan's mother hadn't had the blessing of the Church. Gahan was a few inches taller than his sibling, and more than one old woman had been heard muttering it was God's way of making sure Lytge Sutherland knew his sins would not be hidden from the sight of the righteous.</p> <p>Gahan had chuckled at their judgment. His father welcomed him as warmly as he had his legitimate son. That fact was his greatest gift, because it would have been less trouble for the earl to leave Gahan in the village, the way many a nobleman did with his bastards.</p> <p>There was no hint of jealousy in his sibling's eyes, which was something Gahan treasured. It wasn't often that the legitimate son welcomed a bastard son at his father's table. Even if their sire invited his by-blow to join the family at the high table, the heir often made it clear that competition for their noble parent's good favor wasn't welcome. But the Sutherlands were strong because they were united. In this case, against the young Fraser laird.</p> <p>"Father, it's imperative that we move our retainers closer to the border," Gahan continued.</p> <p>"I agree," Norris said. "Even with the hawks to warn us, the snow melts later here than on Fraser land."</p> <p>The mood in the great hall was subdued. Conversation wasn't flowing along the long trestle tables filling the large space in front of the dais where the high table sat. The Sutherland retainers were doing their best to listen in. The earl frowned and leaned forward to scowl at his clansmen. He thumped his goblet on the table and stood up. The young boy assigned to his cup leaned around him to snatch it up now that it was no longer in his laird's grasp. Gahan found himself watching the drinking vessel to make sure it wasn't unattended. His gut tightened, just a fraction, as he waited for the lad's fingers to close around the silver stem. One careless moment of inattention could-and nearly had-cost his father his life.</p> <p>Someone moved near the front of the dais, drawing Gahan's attention. His sister-by-marriage climbed the three steps and lowered herself before Lytge. Daphne MacLeod waited only a moment before offering Norris, her husband, a smile, and moving to join him. Her dark eyes sparkled with merriment, and her belly was large and round.</p> <p>"Agreeing or nae does nae matter," Lytge said firmly. The earl raised his voice so it would carry. "We've had enough of assumptions clouding the thinking of the men inside this hall."</p> <p>Gahan ground his teeth with frustration but had to agree. Daphne frowned, looking between them as she sat down. Silence hung over the table as she tried to catch the earl's eye and then Gahan's. Gahan reached for his own goblet to avoid her scrutiny. She tapped a single fingernail on the surface of the table impatiently, and Lytge broke.</p> <p>"'Tis naught to concern yerself with, lass," the earl said.</p> <p>"If it involves trouble with the Frasers, it concerns me. I find marriage agrees with me, and I am in no hurry to be a widow," Daphne argued. She reached for Norris's hand and clasped it. Gahan stared at the touch, because he was almost certain Daphne had reached for his brother's hand out of instinct. There was a bond between the pair that intrigued him. Norris was the heir, the legitimate son of the Earl of Sutherland. Daphne was the daughter of a laird. Their match was logical and brought a great deal of gain to the clan. Yet they loved each other. It was evident in every look his brother cast toward his bride. Norris could have had any daughter of any Highland laird, and more than one had tried her luck at snaring his affection.</p> <p>But they had all been disappointed. And then fate had brought Daphne into his path.</p> <p>Gahan stood up. He tugged on the corner of his bonnet in respect before leaving the high table. There was a line of maids waiting to serve the table; two of them leaned over to offer him a view of their cleavage. He passed them by without a second glance. Sandra Fraser's face flashed across his memory every time a woman flirted with him now. He saw the calculating gleam in her eyes as she had tried to convince him to turn traitor against his brother. The maids were no different, he thought bitterly; their goal was to use him to better their lot. Most of them wouldn't hesitate to pray for a babe, simply to make sure they had a reason to expect support from him. None of them understood what it was like to be the bastard son. True, his sire had always provided for him, but the gossips had always made sure he knew that support might be ended at any moment. The Church would consider it his lot to endure on his own, since he was born in sin.</p> <p>"Ye're stewing in dark thoughts again."</p> <p>"And ye're forgetting that being me man is nae the same as being me brother," Gahan growled at his half-brother Cam. Their common blood came from their mother. Cam was legitimate.</p> <p>"It's pretty much the same, only our mother is nae here to smack ye on the top of yer hairy head when you growl."</p> <p>Gahan grinned in spite of his dark mood. "She wielded a spoon like a sword, sure enough." He reached up and rubbed the top of his head. "I was sure I'd have lumps for life."</p> <p>"Maybe ye do, beneath all that devil-dark hair," Cam suggested playfully. "It's spread to yer face again." He pulled a dirk from the top of his boot. "I can remedy that."</p> <p>Gahan rubbed the short beard decorating his face. It was groomed to perfection. "It will have grown back in before morning, so save yer effort." To be smooth-faced, he'd have to shave it twice a day. His duties didn't often allow him so much time to devote to vanity.</p> <p>Dunrobin was a large castle. As Gahan climbed the stairs, he enjoyed stretching his legs on his way to his chamber. On the fourth floor of the second keep, the chamber was spacious, but he still wasn't at ease inside it. As head of Norris's retainers, his duty had been to guard his brother's back. It was something Gahan had never expected to change, but their father had decreed differently. He could not legitimize him, because his mother had died before Norris's, but the earl had recognized Gahan in the Church, in front of the clan. In the Highlands, that was as good as Lytge marrying Gahan's mother posthumously, and that secured Gahan's place in the same instant. Gahan had his own retainers now, and Cam was his captain.</p> <p>"Ye might at least wipe that scowl off yer face," Cam scolded as he helped Gahan remove his sword. "There are surely more than a few bastards who would like to have their father give them a position that includes fine chambers."</p> <p>"Aye, I am nae blind to the blessings given to me, but tell me ye are nae feeling stifled inside these walls," Gahan said.</p> <p>Cam opened his mouth but shut it again without answering. Gahan chuckled and let his brother take his doublet away. Neither of them had been raised to expect more than enough to survive. Lytge's lady wife had not been fond of their common-born mother-or of her sons. While the lady had lived, neither of them had set foot inside Dunrobin.</p> <p>"Ye seem to have ideas about getting out into the spring weather," Cam stated suggestively. "I believe me duties do include anticipating what ye'd enjoy."</p> <p>Gahan grinned. "There are times I like hearing that brotherly tone in yer voice."</p> <p>"Even if it means I know ye too well?"</p> <p>Gahan rolled his shoulders and popped his neck. "Since ye know me so well, do nae disappoint me by nae being ready at first light."</p> <p>Cam eyed him suspiciously. "Yer father was very clear."</p> <p>"Me father is nae finished discussing the topic. He's done only with the part he's willing to let his men hear."</p> <p>Gahan didn't say any more. He moved to one of the large arched windows. It was set with shutters of glass panes that opened outward. Behind him, he heard Cam leave the chamber and close the door. The sound was still a bit jarring. Outside that door there would be two retainers. As the acknowledged son of the earl, he was never alone. Sandra Fraser had proven just how necessary protection was. Even Cam would not spend the night alone. He'd retire with the other men. Growing up in the village had not prepared Gahan for such a life. His father had seen to his training and moved Gahan into Dunrobin the day after the earl's noble wife had died.</p> <p>He drew in a deep breath to dispel his discontentment. His life was a fine one. No man went through his days without feeling the weight of his responsibilities on his back. At least no man worthy of respect. He had a place at Dunrobin, and Bari would not find it simple to strike against them.</p> <p>That was something he was going to make very sure of.</p> <p>There was a hint of spring in the night breeze. Somewhere there was newly turned earth and trees budding. The moonlight sparkled off snow, but the river was roaring in the distance, proof that the ice was melting and spring was on its way. Behind him the fire in the hearth was burning low. There was plenty of firewood stacked nearby, but he let the flames die. It was not so cold that he needed a fire for warmth, and he enjoyed the darkness.</p> <p>Morning would come early, but he remained in the window frame, waiting to see if his instincts were right. He heard the scraping of the stone against the floor before turning around to see a section of the wall pushing inward. A figure loomed in the darkness before stepping into the chamber.</p> <p>"What does Father say?" Gahan asked Norris.</p> <p>"I'll tell ye meself." His father's voice came from inside the passageway. "As soon as me knees stop complaining about climbing a few stairs."</p> <p>Lytge Sutherland made his way through the opening in the wall. "I am going to enjoy the spring warmth." He stopped for a moment and considered Gahan. "But I cannae be enjoying the new season if we're feuding."</p> <p>Gahan grinned. "As I said, I will be happy to address the situation."</p> <p>"Nae without me, will ye," Norris insisted.</p> <p>Lytge sat down in a large chair near the hearth. The coals cast a red glow over him. "I did nae always spend so many hours in thought. There was a time when I was young enough to follow me passions." The earl looked at Gahan, and his lips rose into a satisfied grin. "Yer mother was one of those times. If she'd lived longer than me wife, I'd have wed her. Ye should nae have to suffer for me sins. Yet ye are bastard-born because I was young and unruly."</p> <p>His father was lost in thought for a moment. At last he drew in a stiff breath and focused.</p> <p>"I've heard rumor that Bari Fraser is making visits to the Matheson. Faolan Chisholms sent word of it. Achaius is bitter over the defeat at Sauchieburn, and his sons are being kept at Court by Lord Home to make sure the Matheson clan is loyal to the new king."</p> <p>Gahan snarled, but his father raised his hand.</p> <p>"I am as suspicious as ye are, most likely more so, for I've known Achaius Matheson longer than ye. He is nae a man to be trusted, but he will say the same of me, for I supported the young prince over his father."</p> <p>"James III was nae worthy of the crown," Gahan growled.</p> <p>"Highlanders do nae follow blindly," Lytge agreed, "which is what makes Achaius a dangerous man. If he thinks Bari Fraser has a just cause, the man might just be willing to meet his end on one last, glorious charge into battle. He'll nae stop to consider the lads who will die along with him, or that those who survive will carry on a feud in his name."</p> <p>"We'll ride out at first light," Norris decided.</p> <p>"Ye'll be staying here," the earl countered. "If ye ride out, the rest of the Highlands will hear we're feuding, and the fact that we have nae said a word about it will nae matter.

Bari wants vengeance, and that's a fact."</p> <p>"He's nae the only one," Gahan muttered.</p> <p>Lytge stood. He paused in front of Gahan and reached up to clasp his shoulder. The earl was not a small man, but Gahan still looked down on him. Gahan was grateful for the low light in the chamber, because for just a moment, his eyes glistened as his sire's strong grip sent a surge of emotion through him.</p> <p>"I'll do ye proud, Father."</p> <p>"Ye'll do Sutherland proud," Lytge told him in a rough voice. "Ye are more than me son. Ye are a laird of Sutherland. Do nae listen to the gossips. Ye have a place here now and always. So kindly do nae let that bastard Bari Fraser slit yer throat.

Recording her memories of their life together in spare, wrenching prose, Mukasonga preserves her mother's voice in a haunting work of art.</p><p>Born in Rwanda in 1956, Scholastique Mukasonga experienced from childhood the violence and humiliation of the ethnic conflicts that shook her country. In 1960, her family was displaced to the polluted and under-developed Bugesera district of Rwanda. Mukasonga was later forced to flee to Burundi. She settled in France in 1992, only two years before the brutal genocide of the Tutsi swept through Rwanda. In the aftermath, Mukasonga learned that 37 of her family members had been massacred. Her first novel, <i>Notre-Dame du Nil</i>, won the Ahmadou Kourouma prize and the Renaudot prize in 2012, as well as the 2013 Oc�ans France � prize, and the 2014 French Voices Award, and was shortlisted for the 2016 International Dublin Literary award. In 2017 memoir <i>Cockroaches</i> was a finalist for the LA Times Charles Isherwood Prize for Autobiographical Prose. <b>About the translator:</b> Jordan Stump received the 2001 French-American Foundation's Translation Prize for his translation of <i>Le Jardin des Plantes</i> by Nobel Prize winner Claude Simon. In 2006, Stump was named Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He has translated the work of Eric Chevillard, Marie Redonnet, Patrick Modiano, Honor� de Balzac, and Jules Verne, among others. He is a professor of French literature at the University of Nebraska."Radiant with love...&nbsp;<i>The Barefoot Woman</i> powerfully continues the tradition of women&#x2019;s work it so lovingly recounts. In Mukasonga&#x2019;s village, the women were in charge of the fire. They stoked it, kept it going all night, every night. In her work &#x2014; six searing books and counting &#x2014; she has become the keeper of the flame." &#x2014; <i><b>The New York Times</b></i><br><br>"A profoundly affecting memoir of a mother lost to ethnic violence. . . A loving, urgent memorial to people now "deep in the jumble of some ossuary" who might otherwise be forgotten in time." <i><b>&#x2014; Kirkus Reviews</b></i><b>&nbsp;(Starred Review)</b><br><br>"The memories of childhood, a lost home, a mother who sacrificed herself are the pounding heart of the book, and Mukasonga has produced a work that anyone who might read it will remember."&nbsp; <b>&#x2013;Eleni Theodoropoulos, <i>Literary Hub,</i> Best Translated Novels of the Decade</b><br><br>"This is an important book written for a strong and loving woman." <b>&#x2014; BOOK<i>ish </i></b>(A Must Read Fiction Selection)<br><br>"Mukasonga is a master of subtle shifts in register &#x2014; a skill inherited, perhaps, from the Rwandan traditions of intricate courtesy and assiduous privacy that Stefania maintained. She turns everything over restlessly: In her prose, poignant reminiscences sharpen into bitter ironies, or laments reveal flashes of comedy, determination, defiance." <i><b>&#x2014; The New York Times Book Review</b></i><br><br><i>"The Barefoot Woman</i>&nbsp;is simultaneously a powerful work of witness and memorial, a loving act of reconstruction, and an unflinching reckoning with the Rwandan Civil War. In sentences of great beauty and restraint, Mukasonga rescues a million souls from the collective noun 'genocide', returning them to us as individual human beings, who lived, laughed, meddled in each other's affairs, worked, decorated their houses, raised children, told stories. An essential and powerful read." <b>&#x2013; Zadie Smith</b><br><br>"A&nbsp;loving tribute to a strong mother and a striking work of memoir. . . Extraordinarily, this story is at times horrifying in its content and at other times playful; lyric in its style and tender in its handling of the central character. While the reader's knowledge of the genocide to come hangs over the narrative, the everyday events often retain a quotidian feeling; Stefania and her neighbors worry over their children but also laugh and celebrate and arrange marriages. As a literary work, this establishes a rare balance. Jordan Stump's translation from the French beautifully conveys this sense of both tragedy and day-to-day joy. . .&nbsp;This is an adoring, gorgeously rendered memorial to a mother and testimony to a people."<b> --Julia Kastner, librarian and blogger at&nbsp;pagesofjulia, in <i>Shelf Awareness</i></b><br><br>"<i><i>The Barefoot Woman</i></i>&nbsp;is a gorgeous book, elegantly written in a way that almost lets you forget how much trauma is woven into every paragraph...a piercing book about the space between fear of death and death itself, and how traditions can sustain a community between those terrible moments.

She was the only survivor. Her new memoir focuses on her mother Stefania, whose primary emphasis was on saving her children from those who considered Tutsis &#x201c;cockroaches&#x201d;, coming up with survival strategies, hiding places, paths to safety. Mukasonga describes Stefania&#x2019;s daily life in Rwanda, and in various lands of exile, hoe in hand, tilling the soil, sowing, weeding, harvesting in cycles of beans, corn, and sorghum. It&#x2019;s a way of life now gone. <i>The Barefoot Woman</i> is a tribute born of the horror of her mother&#x2019;s 'poor remains dissolved into the stench of the genocide&#x2019;s monstrous mass grave', crafted by a daughter who hopes that her 'sentences weave a shroud for [her] missing body.'&nbsp;<b>&#x2013;&nbsp;Jane Ciabattari,&nbsp;<i>BBC Culture</i></b> <br><br>"Ever clear and laudable...is Mukasonga&#x2019;s consistent portrayal of her mother as a guardian of the family and of Rwandan lore and customs in the deadly wake of expulsion and exile." &#x2013;&nbsp;Angela Ajayi,&nbsp;<b><i>The&nbsp;</i>(Minneapolis)&nbsp;<i>Star Tribune</i></b><br><br>"The fiercest of wars are fought by so many invisible heroes.&nbsp; The boldest of warriors will take on hell, descend into its depths, armed with a fiery love and set it differently alight.

They are greeted with a pamphlet instructing immigrants how to act like "the English." Jack acquires Savile Row suits and a Jaguar. He buys his marmalade from Fortnum &amp; Mason and learns to list the entire British monarchy back to 913 A.D. He never speaks German, apart from the occasional curse.<br>But the one key item that would make him feel fully British-membership in a golf club-remains elusive. In post-war England, no golf club will admit a Rosenblum. Jack hatches a wild idea: he'll build his own.<br>It's an obsession Sadie does not share, particularly when Jack relocates them to a thatched roof cottage in Dorset to embark on his project. She doesn't want to forget who they are or where they come from. She wants to bake the cakes she used to serve to friends in the old country and reminisce. Now she's stuck in an inhospitable landscape filled with unwelcoming people, watching their bank account shrink as Jack pursues his quixotic dream.</p><p>At the start of World War II, Jack and Sadie Rosenblum flee Berlin for London with their baby daughter, Elizabeth. Upon arrival, Jack receives a pamphlet from the German Jewish Aid Committee on how to act like a proper Englishman. He follows it to the letter - Saville Row suits, the BBC, trips to Covent Garden, a Jaguar&#x2014;and it works like a charm. The Rosenblums settle into a prosperous new life. Just one item on the list eludes him: An Englishman must be a member of a golf course. No golf course in England at the time will admit a Jew. But the list is now the guiding document in Jack's life, and he must check off the final item. So he decides to build his own golf club in the Dorset countryside. For the second time, Sadie leaves a home she loves. And despite ancient customs, British snobbery, mythical beasts, and a shrinking bank account, they triumph once again.Natasha Solomons is a screenwriter who lives in Dorset, England. <i>Mr Rosenblum Dreams in English</i> is her first novel and was inspired in part by her childhood spent at the cottage her own grandparents bought with restitution money from Germany. The recipes in the novel are from her grandmother's ancient cookbook.

They are more accurately understood as a type of expulsion--from professional livelihood, from living space, even from the very biosphere that makes life possible.</p><p>This hard-headed critique updates our understanding of economics for the twenty-first century, exposing a system with devastating consequences even for those who think they are not vulnerable. From finance to mining, the complex types of knowledge and technology we have come to admire are used too often in ways that produce elementary brutalities. These have evolved into predatory formations--assemblages of knowledge, interests, and outcomes that go beyond a firm's or an individual's or a government's project.</p><p>Sassen draws surprising connections to illuminate the systemic logic of these expulsions. The sophisticated knowledge that created today's financial "instruments" is paralleled by the engineering expertise that enables exploitation of the environment, and by the legal expertise that allows the world's have-nations to acquire vast stretches of territory from the have-nots. <i>Expulsions </i>lays bare the extent to which the sheer complexity of the global economy makes it hard to trace lines of responsibility for the displacements, evictions, and eradications it produces--and equally hard for those who benefit from the system to feel responsible for its depredations.</p></p><p>Saskia Sassen is Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology and co-chair of the Committee on Global Thought at Columbia University.&#x201c;In this intellectually audacious and persuasive book, <b>Sassen</b> exposes the fundamental forces at play in current forms of economic, political, and social structures. She correctly contrasts the world as most people understand it with the world as it is actually evolving, towards an extreme form of capitalism with activities that occur across international borders&#x2015;to devastating effects. This is a powerful, highly relevant, and timely book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Patricia Fern�ndez-Kelly, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Expulsions</i> is original, thoughtful, evidence-based, and chillingly lucid. There is no other book like it. Its arguments on growing inequality, land grabs, financial footlooseness, and biospheric destruction are a diagnosis of our unstable and disconcerting times&#x2015;a much-needed wake-up call.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ash Amin, University of Cambridge</b><br><br>&#x201c;Once again, sociologist Sassen uses her considerable knowledge to think creatively at both the local and global levels...In place of the principle of inclusion in the pre-1980s Keynesian era, the planet is increasingly dominated by a principle of exclusion of people, land, natural resources, and water. Sassen presents a powerful conceptual analysis and an equally powerful and timely call to action.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>M. Oromaner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Saskia Sassen&#x2019;s <i>Expulsions</i> describes the global forces that make ever more tenuous and fragile most people&#x2019;s grip on the places where they live.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rowan Moore</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Observer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Coupled with her earlier work, this may be a paradigm breaking/making work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael D. Kennedy</b><b>, </b><b><i>Contemporary Sociology</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Sassen offers a clear and rather heuristic argument that we could hardly ignore in trying to make sense of dynamics of in/exclusion under global financial capitalism, their mutual connections, and their locally diverse configurations...This work has the potential to generate not only insightful reflections on large-scale hyper-concentrations of capital and related global dynamics of people and places&#x2019; expulsions, but also to engage inquiries into urban social dynamics that are invisible to macro analyses.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Giovanni Picker</b><b>, </b><b><i>Urban Studies</i></b></p><h2>Immortality and Reincarnation: Wisdom from the Forbidden Journey</h2><p>Famed traveler and mystic Alexandra David-Neel, the first Western woman to see the forbidden city of Lhasa, Tibet, examines Eastern concepts of the afterlife in this classic study. <br><br>The question of what occurs to the individual personality after death is fundamental to the human experience.

Focusing on queer female diasporic subjectivity, Gopinath develops a theory of diaspora apart from the logic of blood, authenticity, and patrilineal descent that she argues invariably forms the core of conventional formulations. She examines South Asian diasporic literature, film, and music in order to suggest alternative ways of conceptualizing community and collectivity across disparate geographic locations. Her agile readings challenge nationalist ideologies by bringing to light that which has been rendered illegible or impossible within diaspora: the impure, inauthentic, and nonreproductive.<p></p><p>Gopinath juxtaposes diverse texts to indicate the range of oppositional practices, subjectivities, and visions of collectivity that fall outside not only mainstream narratives of diaspora, colonialism, and nationalism but also most projects of liberal feminism and gay and lesbian politics and theory. She considers British Asian music of the 1990s alongside alternative media and cultural practices. Among the fictional works she discusses are V. S. Naipaul&#x2019;s classic novel <i>A House for Mr. Biswas</i>, Ismat Chughtai&#x2019;s short story &#x201c;The Quilt,&#x201d; Monica Ali&#x2019;s <i>Brick Lane</i>, Shyam Selvadurai&#x2019;s <i>Funny Boy</i>, and Shani Mootoo&#x2019;s <i>Cereus Blooms at Night</i>. Analyzing films including Deepa Mehta&#x2019;s controversial <i>Fire</i> and Mira Nair&#x2019;s <i>Monsoon Wedding</i>, she pays particular attention to how South Asian diasporic feminist filmmakers have reworked Bollywood&#x2019;s strategies of queer representation and to what is lost or gained in this process of translation. Gopinath&#x2019;s readings are dazzling, and her theoretical framework transformative and far-reaching.<br></p></p><p>&#34;Boldly spanning Hindi film, British Asian music, Urdu literature, diasporic postcolonial literature and film, U.S. queer activism, and feminist politics, Gayatri Gopinath argues that queer desire becomes central to the ways in which national and diasporic histories are told when the erotics of power is acknowledged. &#34;Impossible Desires&#34; is a deft demonstration of both queer theory&#39;s dominant ethnocentrism and diaspora and postcolonial studies&#39; heteronormativity and androcentrism.&#34;--Ranjana Khanna, author of &#34;Dark Continents: Psychoanalysis and Colonialism&#34;<p>Gayatri Gopinath is Assistant Professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of California, Davis.</p></p><h2>The Passion According to G.H.

Changiz is a Special Forces legend. He also happens to be the first Muslim Green Beret.</p><p> Changiz served this country starting with Operation Eagle Claw in 1980, when he entered Tehran on a one-man mission to spy on Iranian soldiers guarding the US Embassy where 52 US diplomats were being held hostage. Three years later, he was in Beirut, Lebanon when a suicide car bomb exploded in front of the US Embassy killing 83 people. Weeks after that, he was shot by Hezbollah terrorists on a night mission.</p><p> In Operation Iraqi Freedom, he led a convoy that was ambushed on its way to Fallujah. He was clearing houses in Mogadishu, Somalia on October, 1993 when a US Black Hawk helicopter was shot down 50 feet away from him in the incident that inspired <i>Black Hawk Down</i>. In 2002, he dressed as a farmer and snuck into Eastern Afghanistan and located Osama Bin Laden for the CIA. </p><p> Along the way, Changiz earned numerous commendations, including the Special Forces Legion of Merit, Purple Hearts, and many others. Last year he was nominated for induction in Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and cited as &#x201c;the finest noncommissioned officer to ever serve in Special Forces.&#x201d;</p><p> His story is an amazing tale of perseverance and courage, of combat and one man&#x2019;s love of his adopted country.</p></p><p><p>Retired Master Sergeant CHANGIZ LAHIDJI is a highly decorated member of the US Special Forces with over 24 years of active service. He&#x2019;s participated in many top-secret missions in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.

Why do we tolerate sagging skin, flagging energy, and lowered libido as we grow older, writing them off as inevitable? We are not victims of our age. Our symptoms are both controllable and avoidable.

Yet, those who encounter koans in the traditional literature or in the context of exploring Zen practice themselves can often find them utterly baffling.<br><br><i>The Flowing Bridge</i> is the first-ever book to address all of the first koans that Zen students encounter in practice--"What is Mu?" "What is the sound of the single hand?" and the so-called "miscellaneous" koans--that have historically been closely guarded by master and disciple as esoteric treasures.<br><br>Elaine MacIness, a Catholic nun and a Zen teacher in the lineage of the renowned master Koun Yamada (author of Wisdom's <i>The Gateless Gate</i>), offers exceptionally valuable guidance to beginners on how to work with koans-and reveals an uncommon depth of insight and an easy technical mastery of Zen's most misunderstood and most powerful tools.

With Allied forces suddenly on European ground, the division&#x2014;Das Reich &#x2014;was called up to counter the invasion. Its march northward to the shores of Normandy, 15,000 men strong, would become infamous as a tale of unparalleled brutality in World War II.&nbsp;<i>Das Reich</i> is Sir Max Hastings&#x2019;s narrative of the atrocities committed by the 2nd SS Panzer Division during June of 1944: first, the execution of 99 French civilians in the village of Tulle on June 9; and second, the massacre of 642 more in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane on June 10. Throughout the book, Hastings expertly shifts perspective between French resistance fighters, the British Secret Service (who helped coordinate the French resistance from afar and on the ground), and the German soldiers themselves. With its rare, unbiased approach to the ruthlessness of World War II, <i>Das Reich</i> explores the fragile moral fabric of wartime mentality.<p></p></p><p>Sir Max Hastings, recipient of the 2012 Pritzker Military Library Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing, has written one of the classic accounts of World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Days after the D-Day invasion, a Division of battle-hardened soldiers from the vicious and unrelenting battlefields on the Eastern Front, the 2nd SS Panzer, &#x201c;Das Reich,&#x201d; marched north from the safe confines of the south France to reinforce the defenders of Hitler's Fortress Europe on the beaches of Normandy.&nbsp;During their march they were hounded for every mile of their march by saboteurs of the French Resistance, as well as by agents of the Allied Special Forces<i>. Das Reich</i> profiles - in Hastings&#x2019; characteristic prose - the horrific reprisals that the 2nd SS Panzer Division exacted upon the citizens of Tulle and Ordour-sur-Glane, which resulted in 99 and 642 deaths, respectively.&nbsp;<i>Das Reich</i> is a chronicle of the some of the most appalling atrocities of World War II.<p><b>Sir Max Hastings</b> is a famed British journalist and military historian who has served as a foreign correspondent for the Evening Standard and as editor-in-chief of the Daily Telegraph.

(Jessie and John Danz Lectures)</h2><p>This important study in ethnomusicology is an attempt by the author &#x2015; a musician who has become a social anthropologist &#x2015; to compare his experiences of music-making in different cultures. He is here presenting new information resulting from his research into African music, especially among the Venda. Venda music, he discovered is in its way no less complex in structure than European music. Literacy and the invention of nation may generate extended musical structures, but they express differences of degree, and not the difference in kind that is implied by the distinction between 'art' and 'folk' music. Many, if not all, of music's essential processes may be found in the constitution of the human body and in patterns of interaction of human bodies in society. Thus all music is structurally, as well as functionally, 'folk' music in the sense that music cannot be transmitted of have meaning without associations between people.<br><br>If John Blacking's guess about the biological and social origins of music is correct, or even only partly correct, it would generate new ideas about the nature of musicality, the role of music in education and its general role in societies which (like the Venda in the context of their traditional economy) will have more leisure time as automation increases.</p><p>&#39;How Musical Is Man?&#39; explores the role of music in society and culture, and of society and culture in music. The author, and anthropologist and ethnomusicologist, draws examples from Western music and from the music of the Transvaal Venda people.</p><h2>Antenna Basics: A guide for the radio hobbyist</h2><p>Antennas are the most important accessory in a radio installation.

Not out of frustration, but rather out of admiration for Delaney&#x2019;s ability to keep me guessing. The novel centers around a murder, a struggling actress, and the dark nature of Baudelaire&#x2019;s poetry. And if you think you know unreliable narrators, just wait until you meet the actress Claire. The trope is familiar: a woman is brutally killed in a hotel room; is her husband the killer? Claire finds herself playing a part in this all-too-real drama in order to rid herself of suspicion and to help catch what now appears to be a serial killer. But is she really acting? Is she crazy? Is she the killer? The story winds this way and that, and my allegiance to Claire followed suit, until Delaney&#x2019;s over-the-top ending arrived. For some, the final acts of <em>Believe Me</em> may push their limits for suspending disbelief. But for me, the events leading up to the final act were so dramatic that a flamboyant conclusion was the only way out. <em>&#x2014;Seira Wilson, Amazon Book Review</em>The&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Girl Before</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Believe Me</i>,<b>&nbsp;JP Delaney</b>&nbsp;has previously written bestselling fiction under other names.</p><h2>Aeneid Book VI: A New Verse Translation</h2><p><p><b>A masterpiece from one of the greatest poets of the century</b></p><p>In a momentous publication, Seamus Heaney's translation of Book VI of the <i>Aeneid</i>, Virgil's epic poem composed sometime between 29 and 19 BC, follows the hero, Aeneas, on his descent into the underworld. In <i>Stepping Stones</i>, a book of interviews conducted by Dennis O'Driscoll, Heaney acknowledged the significance of the poem to his writing, noting that "there's one Virgilian journey that has indeed been a constant presence, and that is Aeneas's venture into the underworld. The motifs in Book VI have been in my head for years--the golden bough, Charon's barge, the quest to meet the shade of the father."</p><p>In this new translation, Heaney employs the same deft handling of the original combined with the immediacy of language and sophisticated poetic voice as was on show in his translation of <i>Beowulf</i>, a reimagining which, in the words of James Wood, "created something imperishable and great that is stainless--stainless, because its force as poetry makes it untouchable by the claw of literalism: it lives singly, as an English language poem."</p></p><p><b>Seamus Heaney</b> (1939-2013) received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995. His poems, plays, translations, and essays include <i>Opened Ground</i>, <i>Electric Light</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>, <i>The Spirit Level</i>, <i>District and Circle</i>, and <i>Finders Keepers</i>. Robert Lowell praised Heaney as the "most important Irish poet since Yeats."<p>[Heaney's] voice carries the authenticity and believability of the plainspoken--even though (herein his magic) his words are anything but plainspoken. His stanzas are dense echo chambers of contending nuances and ricocheting sounds. And his is the gift of saying something extraordinary while, line by line, conveying a sense that this is something an ordinary person might actually say. &#x2015;Brad Leithauser, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"So fresh and compelling that those who have never enjoyed this classic may want to give it another try . . . Heaney deftly highlights the dramatic tension of the opening passages . . . The language Heaney employs&#x2015;a skillful mix of poetic phrasing and plainspokenness&#x2015;gives the narrative a wonderful immediacy . . . The result is an interpretation that shows why the ancient text is both timely and timeless."&#x2015;Elizabeth Lund, <i>The Washington Post</i></p><br><p>"The book as a whole is instilled with Heaney's mastery of music&#x2015;of rhythm, meter, and lineation . . . A remarkable and fitting epilogue to one of the great poetic careers of recent times."&#x2015;Nick Laird, <i>Harper's</i></p><p>"Seamus Heaney once wrote that Osip Mandelstam&#x2019;s translation of Dante&#x2019;s <i>Divine Comedy</i> 'possesses the poem as a musician possesses the score, both as a whole structure and as a sequence of delicious sounds.' The same could be said of Heaney&#x2019;s own translation of Book VI of the <i>Aeneid</i> . . . A lovely rendition of one of the most stylistically rich books of the <i>Aeneid</i>. Though he hews closer to the original Latin than in his other translations, Heaney&#x2019;s text is . . . a work of distinctive and poetic English." &#x2015;Christopher Carroll, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p></p><h2>Beautiful You</h2><p><p><b>"A billion husbands are about to be replaced."</b><br><br>From the author of <i>Fight Club</i>, the classic portrait of the damaged contemporary male psyche, now comes this novel about the apocalyptic marketing possibilities of a new product that gives new meaning to the term "self-help."&nbsp;<br><br>Penny Harrigan is a low-level associate in a big Manhattan law firm with an apartment in Queens and no love life at all.

Ida Joner held up her hands and counted her fingers. Her birthday was on the tenth of September. And it was only the first today. There were so many things she wanted. Most of all she wanted a pet of her own. Something warm and cuddly that would belong only to her. Ida had a sweet face with large brown eyes. Her body was slender and trim, her hair thick and curly. She was bright and happy. She was just too good to be true. Her mother often thought so, especially whenever Ida left the house and she watched her daughters back disappear around the corner. Too good to last. Ida jumped up on her bicycle, her brand-new Nakamura bicycle. She was going out. The living room was a mess: she had been lying on the sofa playing with her plastic figures and several other toys, and it was chaos when she left. At first her absence would create a great void. After a while a strange mood would creep in through the walls and fill the house with a sense of unease. Her mother hated it. But she could not keep her daughter locked up forever, like some caged bird. She waved to Ida and put on a brave face. Lost herself in domestic chores. The humming of the vacuum cleaner would drown out the strange feeling in the room. When her body began to grow hot and sweaty, or started to ache from beating the rugs, it would numb the faint stabbing sensation in her chest which was always triggered by Ida going out. She glanced out of the window. The bicycle turned left. Ida was going into town. Everything was fine; she was wearing her bicycle helmet. A hard shell that protected her head. Helga thought of it as a type of life insurance. In her pocket she had her zebra-striped purse, which contained thirty kroner about to be spent on the latest issue of Wendy. She usually spent the rest of her money on Bugg chewing gum. The ride down to Lailas Kiosk would take her fifteen minutes. Her mother did the mental arithmetic. Ida would be back home again by 6:40 P.M. Then she factored in the possibility of Ida meeting someone and spending ten minutes chatting. While she waited, she started to clean up. Picked up toys and figures from the sofa. Helga knew that her daughter would hear her words of warning wherever she went. She had planted her own voice of authority firmly in the girls head and knew that from there it sent out clear and constant instructions. She felt ashamed at this, the kind of shame that overcomes you after an assault, but she did not dare do otherwise. Because it was this very voice that would one day save Ida from danger. Ida was a well-brought-up girl who would never cross her mother or forget to keep a promise. But now the wall clock in Helga Joners house was approaching 7:00 P.M., and Ida had still not come home.

T</p><h2>The Watcher in the Shadows</h2><p><b>A chilling</b><b>, compelling mystery<em> </em></b><b>from the internationally bestselling author of <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i><em>.</em></b><em><br><br></em>When fourteen-year-old Irene Sauvelle moves with her family to Cape House on the coast of Normandy, she's immediately taken by the beauty of the place--its expansive cliffs, coasts, and harbors. There, she meets a local boy named Ishmael, and the two soon fall in love. But a dark plot is about to unfold involving a reclusive toymaker who lives in a gigantic mansion filled with mechanical beings and shadows of the past.<br><br>As strange lights shine through the fog surrounding a small, barren island, Irene's younger brother dreams of a dark creature hidden deep in the forest. And when a young girl is found murdered, her body at the end of a path torn through the woods by a monstrous, inhuman force, Irene and Ishmael wonder--has a demonic presence been unleashed on the inhabitants of Cape House? Together, they'll have to survive the most terrifying summer of their lives.</p><p><b>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Prince of Mist </i>and the international phenomena<i> The Shadow of the Wind </i>and <i>The Angel's Game</i>. His work has been published<i> </i>in more than fifty countries and honored with numerous awards. He<i> </i>divides his time between Barcelona, Spain, and Los Angeles, California.First published in Spain in 1995, this early work from Zaf�n hits all the gothic horror bases: creepy castles, foreboding caves, haunted lighthouses, murky woods, masked balls, and just about everything else you might hope for. Mostly, though, this is a cunning twist on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#x2014;with a little bit of ventriloquist-dummy horror thrown in for good measure. Fourteen-year-old Irene&#x2019;s penniless mother has just won the jackpot: she&#x2019;s been hired to keep house at Cravenmoore, the estate of reclusive toymaker Lazarus Jann. He&#x2019;s a kindly eccentric, but the grinning automatons populating his castle carry an air of menace. Just as frightening is the personless shadow giving chase to Irene and her little brother. And what of the legend of the woman who drowned in the lagoon? Though there is probably one mystery too many here, Zaf�n cuts between his various characters with cinematic skill, and his habit of telling stories within the narrative is put to spine-tingling use, just as it was with The Midnight Palace (2011). Good, solid scares. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Zaf�n is still cruising off the might of the international best-sellers The Shadow of the Wind (2004) and The Angel&#x2019;s Game (2009). Anything he does for quite a while will garner a good deal of interest.

During her life on the island of Lesbos, Sappho is said to have composed nine books of lyrics. Only one poem has survived complete. In &#34;If Not, Winter&#34;, Carson presents all the extant fragments of Sappho&#39;s verse, employing brackets and white space to denote missing text - allowing the reader to imagine the poems as they were written. Carson says of her method of translation: &#34;I like to think that, the more I stand out of the way, the more Sappho shows through&#34;. Her translation illuminates Sappho&#39;s reflections on love and desire, her companions and rivals, the goddess Aphrodite and her own daughter, Kleis. The book brings us an ancient poet brought to life by an empathetic contemporary poet, and is complete with an introduction and notes.</p><p>Of the nine books of lyrics the ancient Greek poet Sappho is said to have composed, only one poem has survived complete. The rest are fragments. In this miraculous new translation, acclaimed poet and classicist Anne Carson presents all of Sappho&#39;s fragments, in Greek and in English, as if on the ragged scraps of papyrus that preserve them, inviting a thrill of discovery and conjecture that can be described only as electric--or, to use Sappho&#39;s words, as &#34;thin fire . . . racing under skin.&#34; By combining the ancient mysteries of Sappho with the contemporary wizardry of one of our most fearless and original poets, If Not, Winter provides a tantalizing window onto the genius of a woman whose lyric power spans millennia.&#x201c;[Sappho&#x2019;s] verse has been elevated to new heights in [this] gorgeous translation.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times<br><br></i> &#x201c;This Sappho is whispering in our ear in a language we can understand.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Time Out New York<br><br></i>&#x201c;Carson is in many ways [Sappho&#x2019;s] ideal translator. . . .

The problem wasn&#x2019;t just the election, but the fact that nobody could explain, in any sort of coherent way, why America had elected a cruel, corrupt, and incompetent man to the Presidency. <em>Bad Stories: What the Hell Just Happened to Our Country</em> is Almond&#x2019;s effort to make sense of our historical moment, to connect certain dots that go unconnected amid the deluge of hot takes and think pieces. Almond looks to literary voices&#x2014;from Melville to Orwell, from Bradbury to Baldwin&#x2014;to help explain the roots of our moral erosion as a people.</p> <p>The book argues that Trumpism is a bad outcome arising directly from the bad stories we tell ourselves. To understand how we got here, we have to confront our cultural delusions: our obsession with entertainment, sports, and political parody, the degeneration of our free press into a for-profit industry, our enduring pathologies of race, class, immigration, and tribalism. <em>Bad Stories</em> is a lamentation aimed at providing clarity. It&#x2019;s the book you can pass along to an anguished fellow traveler with the promise, <em>This will help you understand what the hell happened to our country</em>.</p></p><p><b>Steve Almond</b> is the author of eight books of fiction and non-fiction, including the <i>New York Times</i> Bestsellers <i>Candyfreak</i> and <i>Against Football</i>.

I ultimately chose a simpler phrase, one that captures something of the bewildment and exasperation so many Americans feel. But I mention that first subtitle to emphasize the nature of my undertaking. I&#x2019;m not offering a single theory, or even a set of theories, as to how our democracy fell apart. I&#x2019;m working <i>toward a synthesis of theories</i>. The ascension of Donald Trump to the presidency is certainly the impetus for this investigation. But it should not be mistaken for my subject. </p><p>In fact, I&#x2019;ve been tracking the odd and lurching course of our democracy for most of my adult life. I&#x2019;ve pursued this interest not as an academic&#x2015;an historian or a political scientist&#x2015;but as a reporter and, more recently, a fiction writer. That makes me a storyteller technically, though I feel more often like a woozy and puzzled student of the American story. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve placed my faith in stories because I believe them to be the basic unit of human consciousness. The stories we tell, and the ones we absorb, are what allow us to pluck meaning from the rush of experience. Only through the patient interrogation of these stories can we begin to understand where we are and how we got here.</p></p><h2>One Taste: Daily Reflections on Integral Spirituality</h2><p>As one who has written extensively about the interior life, meditation, and psychotherapy, Ken Wilber&#x2014;the leading theorist in the field of integral psychology&#x2014;naturally arouses the curiosity of his numerous readers. In response to this curiosity, this one-year diary not only offers an unprecedented entr�e into his private world, but offers an introduction to his essential thought. "If there is a theme to this journal," Wilber writes, "it is that body, mind, and the luminosities of the soul&#x2014;all are perfect expressions of the Radiant Spirit that alone inhabits the universe, sublime gestures of that Great Perfection that alone outshines the world." <br><br>Wilber's personal writings include: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Details of his own spiritual practice <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Advice to spiritual seekers <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Reflections on his work and that of other prominent theorists in the field of integral psychology <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; His day-to-day personal experiences <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Dozens of his short theoretical essays on topics from art to feminism to spirituality to psychotherapy</p><p>Okay, Ken Wilber fans, you've waited long enough. The intensely private potentate of the integral path has broken his silence and published a year's worth of journal notes. Pull up a chair. You've entered the living room of one of the most intriguing spiritual theorists on the planet. He'll tell you a little about his work schedule, friendships with publishers, artists, and intellectuals, and you'll talk late into the night about bringing together the best parts of all the world's wisdom traditions. Hold on tight, though, because the conversational pace can be dizzying, bouncing from Nagarjuna to Plotinus, Derrida to Nagel, feminism to Zen, psychotherapy to vipassana. And this isn't just superficial soul-babble. Give it a while to sink in. Take a sip of wine. Move on to more expansive talk of higher states of being. Wilber will describe his own meditative experiences and how they relate to his revision of the Great Chain of Being. As daylight breaks, you'll gaze into the early twilight, wondering how you failed to notice all those hidden dimensions within and beyond an otherwise two-dimensional world. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Ken Wilber-the leading theorist in the field of transpersonal psychology-has written extensively about meditation, psychotherapy, and the interior life.

The result of that journey is a gorgeous, evocative meditation on fate, death, consciousness, and what it means to be human. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Darker the Night, The Brighter the Stars </i>weaves a scientist&#x2019;s understanding of the mind &#x2013; its logic, its nuance, <i>how</i> we think about what makes a person &#x2013; with a poet&#x2019;s approach to humanity, that crucial and ever-elusive <i>why</i>. It&#x2019;s a story that unfolds through the centuries, along the path of humankind&#x2019;s constant quest to discover what makes us human, and the answers that consistently slip out of our grasp. It&#x2019;s modern medicine and psychology and ancient tales; history and myth combined; fiction and the stranger truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> But, most importantly, it&#x2019;s Broks&#x2019; story, grounded in his own most fascinating cases as a clinician&#x2014;patients with brain injuries that revealed something fundamental about the link between the raw stuff of our bodies and brains and the ineffable <i>selves</i> we take for who we are.&nbsp;Tracing a loose arc of loss, acceptance, and renewal,<i> </i>he unfolds striking, imaginative stories of everything from Schopenhauer to the Greek philosophers to jazz guitarist Pat Martino in order to sketch a multifaceted view of humanness that is as heartbreaking at it is affirming.</p><p><b>Paul Broks</b> is an English neuropsychologist and science writer.

It goes all through the day, all through the night. My wife exhales, like a sign of resignation. It&#x2019;s six in the evening and she hasn&#x2019;t opened her eyes today, or spoken a word. This day, between her birthday and our wedding anniversary, is the day she dies. Yesterday the boys and I dabbed green tea on her lips and she smiled, but not today. Another long sigh. Her final breath? Not yet. There&#x2019;s another, and another. And then no more. The last is like the wash of a wave fading into sand. The oxygen machine is still breathing. I remove the wedding ring from my wife&#x2019;s dead finger, and box it in my fist. The machine exhales. I exhale. It scarcely missed a breath, this ring. I turn off the oxygen machine. Kate lies bathed in evening sunlight, the flesh of her arms already beginning to bruise with draining blood.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the autumnal equinox, September 23rd. The sun had crossed the celestial equator and our last summer was behind us. Perfect timing. She couldn&#x2019;t face another winter, she&#x2019;d said. There was a full moon that night. I stood in the backyard. I took a slug of whiskey and I thought: What next? We had discussed <i>what next </i>a good deal that summer, knowing her death was imminent. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried about you.&#x201d; I had a lot going for me. It would be a release.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And it won&#x2019;t be long now.&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s all right then.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But, I&#x2019;ll tell you something. You don&#x2019;t know how precious life is. You think you do, but you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn&#x2019;t argue with her. She was dying. What did I know? I look back on it now as a good summer, despite everything: painful, penetratingly sad, but without despair, and shot through with extraordinary moments of joy. It vindicated our decision. Precisely one hundred days before she died we were sitting in another sunlit room at the hospital. A doctor was telling us that the cancer had spread beyond all hope of containment. &#x201c;How long?&#x201d; Kate asked, and ventured her own estimate: &#x201c;Six months?&#x201d; But there was a pause before the doctor answered, &#x201c;Perhaps.&#x201d; The best he could offer, the last resort, was another course of chemotherapy, which, if it worked, would extend her life by a couple of months at best. It would be the kind of chemotherapy that made your hair and fingernails fall out, and made you sick to your bones. We knew all about chemotherapy. And the chances of it working? &#x201c;One in five.&#x201d; We didn&#x2019;t have to decide right there and then, the doctor said, the following week would do, but the disease was moving fast and treatment, if that was the choice, could not be delayed much longer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agreed, on the drive home, that it was not a decision to take on impulse. We would discuss it with Tom and Nat, our sons; we would weigh the pros and cons and do our best to make sense of the uncertainties. And in the days that followed we did those things. There was no agenda. Discussion came piecemeal over lunch on the patio, or watching the sunset up on the seafront, or in the quiet of the early hours, and we assembled the fragments forensically. It&#x2019;s your decision, the boys said. We&#x2019;ll support you in whatever you do.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first thoughts, back there in the consulting room, had lined up pretty smartly against the idea of further treatment. Even as the doctor spoke, I was doing the existential equations. I factored in the probabilities alongside the pain and indignities, and I could see no good reason to intensify and prolong the suffering, which was already considerable. The end was inevitable and close now, treatment or not. Better to take what we could from the last days, not lose them to the ordeal of chemotherapy. If the treatment didn&#x2019;t work, which was likely, then it would just be adding insult to injury.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept those thoughts to myself at the time. If Kate was forming a different view, and I got the impression she was, then it was not for me to interfere. It was her life. And before long I began to see other sides to the argument. She had responded well to aggressive forms of chemotherapy in the past. Why not now? And why was the doctor being so conservative, so pessimistic, about the outcome? Oncology is not an exact science. They get these things badly wrong sometimes. I was given six months to live, you hear people saying, and here I am, five years on, fighting fit! So, I made the case for treatment. I said perhaps it was worth a shot. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to die with no hair,&#x201d; she said. Rational deliberation had little to do with it in the end. It came down to a <i>feeling of rightness</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are practical matters to deal with in the minutes and hours following a death. I called a doctor to conduct the certification, and a soft-spoken Ghanaian man showed up. I asked him if he could recommend an undertaker because, bizarrely in retrospect, I hadn&#x2019;t given the matter any thought. The doctor went on his way and I called the Co-operative Funeral Service and, while we were waiting for the undertaker, the boys and I took turns to say goodbye. I stroked her hair. When the body was removed, we&#x2014;Tom, Nat and I, and Nat&#x2019;s wife, Rosie&#x2014;ate some pasta and drank some wine. We talked about Kate. Her death felt, unexpectedly, like an accomplishment. It was a peaceful end, we agreed, a dignified one, and the suffering was over. I could not face spending the night in our, now just <i>my</i>, bedroom, so I laid a mattress on the floor in Tom&#x2019;s. I read Seneca&#x2019;s <i>Letters from a Stoic </i>for a while before settling to sleep, and I slept well. The next day, our anniversary, I took Kate&#x2019;s wedding ring to a jeweler for resizing. I&#x2019;d promised her I would wear it for the rest of my life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days that followed there was the funeral to arrange, and details to gather for the Registrar of Births and Deaths, who, when I got to see him, told me he was sorry for my loss, a phrase that must pass his lips fifty times a week, and then he gave me an oldfashioned fountain pen to sign some forms. Then there&#x2019;s the funeral, and that&#x2019;s it. A life concluded; a death documented.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the memories started pushing through. Doors opened into unexpected rooms. Through this window, a crisp winter morning, through that, a summer&#x2019;s afternoon. Fragments of childhood swirled up like leaves in a flurry. Schooldays. Work. The early years with Kate. I opened the back door and there we were, standing in a downpour. The scent of hard rain on dry earth. Soaked to the skin. Alive. The images were involuntary and spasmodic, as if my brain were trying to gather threads of meaning without much involving &#x201c;me,&#x201d; churning the memories, poking and probing. Reconstructing. <i>Who are you? What next?</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What next? No idea. I was wandering through a mist, not knowing what to expect when the sun burns through. <i>When I&#x2019;m gone, just get on and do whatever you must</i>. But what? Sell the house, she said. Pack in the job. Move to another town. Find another woman. Anything. <i>I&#x2019;ll be just a memory</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to follow Kate&#x2019;s advice and retire from work at the earliest opportunity. <i>You&#x2019;re getting stale. </i>I was. <i>You&#x2019;ve no appetite</i>. True. <i>Let go</i>. She had it all figured out. I could use her life insurance money to pay off the mortgage, and, within a couple of years, I&#x2019;d be eligible to apply for an early retirement package, which would give me a small pension to live on. So I found myself entering a branch of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, briskly signing a check for ninety-six thousand, four hundred and eighty- eight pounds, forty-three pence, and going back out into the street with a tear running down my cheek. You get those stabs of absence to the gut when you least expect them. Eighteen months later I resigned my university post and got on with the things I&#x2019;d much rather be getting on with.

Unless he enters a guilty plea he will almost certainly be sentenced to death. But it is not his own death that weighs most heavily on him but a tender longing for his sister, Juana, whom he hasn't seen for years. Before he dies he wants nothing more than to be reunited with her.&nbsp;Fans of both Roberto Bola�o&nbsp;and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez will find much to admire in this story about the mean streets of Bogot�, the sordid bordellos of Thailand, and a love between siblings that knows no end.&nbsp;<br><br>As a boy, Manuel was a dreamer, a lover of literature, and a tagger. His sister Juana&nbsp;made a promise to do everything in her power to protect him from the drug-and violence-infested streets of Bogot�. She decided to take him as far from Colombia as possible, and in order to raise the money to do so, she went to work as a high-priced escort and entered into contact with the dangerous world of corrupt politicians. When things spun out of control she was forced to flee, leaving her beloved brother behind.&nbsp;<br><br>Juana and Manuel's story reaches the ears of the Colombian counsel general in New Delhi, and he tracks down Juana, now married to a rich Japanese man, in Tokyo. The counsel general takes it upon himself to reunite the two siblings&#x2014;a feat that may be beyond his power.&nbsp;<br><br>With the stylishness that has earned him a reputation as one of "the most important Colombian writers" (Manuel V�zquez Montalb�n), Santiago Gamboa lends his story a driving, irresistible rhythm.</p><p>Novelist, short story writer, and journalist,&nbsp;<b>Santiago Gamboa </b>was born in Colombia in 1965.

Wouldn&#x2019;t it be more natural, and more proper, to not be calm at all? In <i>Compassion</i>, Christina Feldman draws over 30 years of experience as a Buddhist to explain how ordinary people are able to use compassion to overcome negative feelings like tragedy, pain, and terror. Feldman first examines compassion itself, using Buddhist texts and real-life stories to explain precisely what this strange force is, and argues that it is the most precious of all gifts. Feldman then proceeds to show, in six separate chapters, how compassion can be used in the face of adversity, mapping out meditations and strategies that can overcome the dark thoughts that everyone experiences. <i>Compassion</i> is for anyone who has ever felt helpless in our own turbulent, uncertain times.</p><p>In the early 1970s, Christina Feldman spent several years in Asia, studying and training in the Buddhist meditation tradition. She has led insight meditation retreats in the West since 1974.

Roger Hargreaves&#39; son Adam asked him what a tickle looked like. In response, Roger drew a small orange man with extraordinarily long arms that could reach anywhere and tickle anyone. The idea that a tickle could be a character in its own right sparked an idea in Roger&#39;s mind. Roger was a successful copywriter but he wanted to do something that would enable him to work from home and spend more time with his four children. He wondered if he could make a living writing and illustrating children&#39;s books so he wrote the first Mr Men titles: Mr Tickle, Mr Greedy, Mr Happy, Mr Nosey, Mr Sneeze and Mr Bump. The books were an instant hit and Roger went on to create many more Mr Men and Little Miss characters. What Roger really wanted was to make children laugh. Mr Silly was his favourite Mr Men story and, according to his family, encapsulates his humour most closely. Sadly Roger passed away in 1988, but his son Adam took over the series, introducing new characters and exciting new adventures. Roger once said, `I feel very happy to think that when the Mr Men and Little Misses are 100 years old, their readers will always be five.&#39;</p><h2>The Lost Ones (A Quinn Colson Novel)</h2><p><b>Fans of <i>Justified</i> and James Lee Burke will love Mississippi lawman Quinn Colson in this&nbsp;Edgar� Award Nominee for Best Novel&nbsp;from the author of </b><i><b>The Ranger...</b></i><br><br>When Army Ranger Quinn Colson, the new sheriff of Tibbehah County, is called out to investigate a child abuse case, what he finds is a horrifying scene of neglect, thirteen empty cribs, and a shoe box full of money.

He lives in Oxford, Mississippi.<p>1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A couple roustabouts had been asking about guns at the Tibbehah County Fair, but by the time the word had gotten back to Donnie Varner, they'd long since packed up their Ferris wheel, corn dog stands and shit, and boogied on down the highway. He'd tried for them at a rodeo up in Eupora and the fall festival over in Hernando, but it wasn't until he pulled off the highway into a roadside carnival in Byhalia, Mississippi, that he knew he had the right spot. It was late, past nine o'clock, and the edge of Highway 78 was lit up in red, blue, and yellow neon, the fairway spreading out past the gas station and into an open cow field, bursting with folks carrying popcorn and balloons, little black kids and white kids, Mexicans working the stands. The air smelled like burnt sugar and cigarettes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"�D&#x2014;nde est&#x2021; Alejandro Ram&#x2019;rez Umana?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A fat brown woman running a stick around a cotton candy dryer nodded to the flashing lights of a Tilt-A-Whirl called the Cool Breeze. As Donnie walked closer, he could see the little cars spinning and zipping up into a fake ice tunnel where folks would scream when getting blasted with cold air and mist. Donnie's white T-shirt was already soaked through from his ride up from Jericho with no air conditioner in a busted-up Dodge van he'd borrowed from his church.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How the hell else could he have brought a sampling of the fifteen AK-47s, two Mossberg 12-gauge shotguns, three MAK-90 assault rifles, a Ruger Mini-14, and a .223 caliber AR variant rifle? There was a mixed bag of ammunition, scopes, magazines, and gun cases to show that he meant business and could deliver more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A dark girl with long legs was taking tickets, black hair pulled back from her face with a pink scarf, wearing a white tank top and shorts, a fat pink belt around her small waist. She was tall and thin, with muscular brown thighs. She wore a pair of old cowboy boots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie smiled at her and repeated: "�D&#x2014;nde est&#x2021; Alejandro Ram&#x2019;rez Umana?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I speak English."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where's he at?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A friend."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A couple kids muscled by Donnie and handed the girl tickets. Both boys looked at the Mexican woman in the damp white tank top and smiled at each other. Their heads swiveled as they made their way up the ramp, nearly tripping over themselves into the Cool Breeze tunnel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I heard he needed some guns," Donnie said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's not true."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Fine by me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't talk so loud."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll be getting a hot dog over at that stand."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What is your name?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Donnie Varner."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Alejandro knows you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just tell him about the guns."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie pulled out a pack of Natural American Spirit cigarettes and thumped them forward, ripping open the box. He fired one up and strolled over to a clump of vendors selling Polish sausages, pizza, barbecue, and Coney Island dogs. He paid two dollars for a footlong and dressed it with mustard and relish, wishing he had a cold Busch beer to wash it down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best thing about going to Trashcanistan and coming back was enjoying every goddamn moment you got. In the good hours, the pleasures seemed more intense. He could smoke cigarettes on his dad's porch all night long, watch the sun rise off the hay his father had rolled and baled. During the bad hours-maybe why he didn't like to sleep-he'd think he was still over there, hearing that market bomb explode near three of his buddies, with parts of forty civilians getting shredded with them. How do you make sense of that?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He'd had three surgeries to remove all the shrapnel that had decorated his back. But the first words out of his father's mouth on a cell phone call from back home was: "Y'all get the bastard?" He had to tell his dad, No. This wasn't Vietnam. These people really didn't have no objective besides blowing themselves to heaven and screwing seventy-two black-eyed virgins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You could smell the turn of the season mixed in the corn dogs and funnel cakes. Mississippi still had hot days, but there was a gentleness to those hot breezes, signaling fall was coming on, chillier weather. Cotton gins were running. People were turning over their crops and planting collards and harvesting pumpkins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie wiped the mustard off his chin and stood and stretched, scratching his chest and lighting up another Spirit. Down the midway in all that neon glow, he spotted that fine Mexican woman, hands in tight pockets of those white shorts, wiggling down the worn path. Cowboy boots kicking up a bit of dust till she got near him and didn't smile but just pointed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Go to the motel."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She pointed again to a little, squat two-level facing a cow pasture and Highway 78.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, there."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Room 211."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do I look that goddamn stupid?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll wait with you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Or you, us," she said. "If you have a wire-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I ain't wearin' no wire."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But if you are-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Alejandro will chimichanga my ass."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She raised her thick eyebrows and nodded, walking ahead of him, making Donnie sweat by the way she walked. He was enjoying the white shorts and cowboy boots, but he wasn't altogether stupid, reaching up under his T-shirt and making sure the .38 Special was tucked in his branded belt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had a key and opened the door on the second floor. Donnie hung back, waiting to hear something, blowing out a thin trail of smoke and staring down at the neon carnival facing the cotton fields, cars headed north to Memphis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Come on."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm good."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Come on," the girl said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie shrugged and wandered in, keeping cool, looking to other doors and then back the way he came. He walked back to the bathroom, heart jackhammering in his chest, checking behind the shower curtain and then strolling out nice and easy. He found the girl facing him, arms across her nice chest, but frowning. "Take off your shirt."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Come on now, sweet thing."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Luz." She had a slight bead of perspiration on her upper lip and rings of sweat under her arms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What kind of Mex name is that?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"An old one."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He peeled off his T-shirt, fronting the girl so she couldn't get a glimpse of his pistol.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And your blue jeans."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hell."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie shook his head, took the lit cigarette out of his mouth, and placed it in an ashtray by the bedside. He reached behind him slow, grinning, and showed her the gun loose in his right hand. "OK?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Be a lot easier if you'd show me, too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You came to us."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A fella can at least try."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She waited till he'd taken his jeans down to his cowboy boots and made a slow turn in his boxer shorts. Her face dropped when he looked at her, and he knew she'd seen the thick, rubbery scars on his back. He pulled his pants up and reached back for his .38, sliding it into his belt, and then slipped into his T-shirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She dialed a number on her cell and sat down on the sagging bed, the cheap bedspread stained and sun-faded. She didn't say anything. She lolled her head in a shrug and crossed her legs, swinging her booted foot back and forth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie walked back to the front door and waited on the balcony, leaning over the railing while he smoked two more cigarettes. He'd heard about these bad dudes down in Biloxi from this fella in Jericho named Ram&#x2014;n, gangbangers from Mexico and out west that blew in after Katrina and decided to stick around and do business, run whatever they could back and forth to Old Mexico. He didn't know nothing about their politics or business, only that they paid in cash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Mexican man turned the corner from the stairwell and nodded at him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alejandro Ram&#x2019;rez Umana's entire face had been scrawled in jailhouse tattoos. He was short and muscular, with a shaved head and small mustache. The black scrollwork on his face showed numbers and letters and drawings of demon horns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alejandro said something fast and harsh in Spanish. Donnie caught about none of it, watching while he pointed out to the wide parking lot, already starting to empty out for the night. She nodded. "He wants you to bring them here. To the motel."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Two miles down the road is a Walmart," Donnie said. "Y'all can meet me in the parking lot for a little look-see. I got a brown Dodge van. Just you and him."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She told him. He answered her, seeming like he was pissed off, keeping an eye on Donnie. Donnie Varner smiled and winked. Alejandro stared at Donnie, seeming kind of like he was an insect, before turning and bounding down the metal steps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He will want to shoot the guns."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That can be arranged."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"First we see the guns. How many can you get?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How many y'all need?" Donnie grinned at Luz. The smile seemed to make her nervous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Many."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Baby, you're too pretty to be at this freak show."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She finally smiled. He handed her a business card.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"See y'all in Tibbehah County."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn Colson did not want or need to attend the annual Good Ole Boy party out at Johnny Stagg's property. But Chief Deputy Lillie Virgil had pointed out it was an unwritten requirement of being sheriff in Tibbehah County, even if Quinn had only been sheriff since a special election in the spring and that election had been against Stagg. And now it was fall. Stagg's behemoth metal barn where he kept tractors and earthmovers had been cleaned out and filled with long tables covered in red-and-white-checked oilcloth and folding chairs borrowed from the three Baptist churches in Jericho. A well-known master of barbecue had brought in his crew from Sugar Ditch, and dozens of steel washtubs had been filled with ice and cans of cheap beer and Coca-Cola. A bonfire blazed at the edge of Stagg's land, where politicians from all over north Mississippi gathered despite the lack of chill in the air.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Johnny Stagg may be this county's biggest asshole," Lillie Virgil said, slamming the door to Quinn's old Ford truck, "but he sure knows how to throw a party."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How long do I have to stay?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do I need to remind you that sheriff is an elected position?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you recall Stagg telling everyone that I suffered from post-traumatic stress and was a loose cannon?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He would've said worse about me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn shut the driver's door and followed Lillie down a gravel road where conversion trucks were parked alongside Cadillacs and Mercedeses. Men had driven north from Jackson or south from Memphis to check out this year's political climate, whether it was for U.S. Senate or the coroner of Choctaw County. There would be stump speeches and political alliances made. After the speeches came the long prayer, and then the meal where hundreds, maybe a thousand, would listen to a country band down from Tupelo fronted by Kay Bain, a spitfire in her seventies who didn't stand much taller than five feet and who could wail as good as Tammy Wynette.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I used to come out here with my uncle," Quinn said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"See," Lillie said. "He hated Stagg back then, too. But he knew it was part of the job."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'd like to punch Johnny Stagg in the throat."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are all you Rangers so damn charming?" Lillie asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn stood tall and rangy, hair buzzed high and tight, wearing a pressed khaki shirt with two front pockets, pressed blue jeans, and shined boots. He kept a Beretta 9mm on his hip, the same one that had served him on numerous missions in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Ranger in the 3rd Batt, 75th Regiment. A patch of the sheriff's office star was sewn on his left pocket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His face was all sharp angles, a hint of Cherokee from some time back. He looked to be a hard man even though he'd yet to turn thirty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"If I were you," Lillie said, "I'd walk right up to Johnny Stagg and shake his hand."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Smile as you walk through the cannon smoke and give 'em hell?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Stagg would hate it if you showed you were a bigger man."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn regarded Lillie as they met the edge of Stagg's land. He looked at her brown curly hair pulled into a ponytail and freckled face without a trace of makeup. She was nearly his height and a hell of a looker when not wearing an oversized sheriff's office jacket and laced clunky boots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if he ever complimented her, she took it as an insult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn said hello to several folks who'd supported him in the election against Stagg, the boldest supporter being old Betty Jo Mize who ran the Tibbehah Monitor. With wry humor, she'd described Johnny Stagg's entire sordid history in her columns-his strip club truck stop and association with criminals. Quinn was pretty sure that's what won him the election.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He hugged the old woman and she winked at him, whispering into his ear. "Glad you're here. That prick will hate it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where's the beer?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Betty Jo smiled and pointed the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn found a cold Budweiser and met up with Mr. Jim, a veteran of Patton's 3rd Army who ran the town barbershop, and Luther Varner, a Marine sniper who'd served in Vietnam. Mr. Jim was talking about shutting down the barbershop again, a rumor he'd been spreading since Quinn was a kid. Luther Varner just smiled as Mr. Jim talked, smoking down a long Marlboro red. He had a faded Semper Fi tattoo on his wrinkled forearm and a face fashioned from granite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"God damn," Varner said. "How long are these folks gonna talk? I'm getting hungry."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They hold the meal just so we have to listen," Mr. Jim said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you listening to this horseshit?" Varner asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A nervous young guy in a tieless suit stood on the small stage filled with guitars and a drum set. He spoke about his love of country and his personal relationship with Jesus Christ. "I am a family man and an avid hunter. No one will take that away from me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn drank his beer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This is more than an election to me," the candidate said. "It's a crusade.

In this romantic comedy, Sugar Beth Carey returns, tail between her legs, to her Mississippi hometown, where she has, as a spoiled, rich, wild, and beautiful teen, alienated just about everybody. Now the tables are turned. How the chastened but still impertinent heroine turns her life around, makes amends, and finds love consumes the book's lighthearted pages. The award-winning Kate Fleming (a.k.a. Anna Fields) gives an uneven, albeit always absorbing, reading. She starts out with a dazzling bang before settling into a pleasant but slightly distant interpretation of the narrative. Her impersonation of Sugar Beth's arrogant love interest fails to convince us of his sex appeal. The sex scenes are flat. On the other hand, the dialogue sparkles delightfully.

When John Rogers packed away his rucksack to start a family in London he didn&#39;t stop travelling. But instead of canoeing up the Rejang River to find retired headhunters in Sarawak, he caught the ferry to Woolwich in search of the edge of the city at Crayford Marshes. This Other London recounts that journey and many others - all on foot and epic in their own cartilage-crunching way. Clutching a samosa and a handful of out-of-date A-Zs, he heads out into the wilderness of isolated luxury apartment blocks in Brentford, the ruins of Lesnes Abbey near Thamesmead, and the ancient Lammas Lands in Leyton. Denounced by his young sons as a &#39;hippy wizard&#39;, Rogers delves into some of the overlooked stories rumbling beneath the tarmac of the city suburbs. Holy wells in Lewisham; wassailing in Clapton; a heretical fresco in West Ham. He encounters the Highwaymen of Hounslow Heath, Viet Cong vets still fighting Stanley Kubrick&#39;s Full Metal Jacket in Beckton, Dutch sailors marooned at Erith pier; and cyclists - without Bradley Wiggins&#39; sideburns - at Herne Hill Velodrome.

Beyond the information that is being conveyed, something deeper happens. For the listener, a field of alert stillness arises where before there was mental noise, signaling the entry to a state of presence that precedes transformation.<br><br>While Tolle's writing is not simple, he does not "speak down" to his audience in any way &#x2014; his talks are far more informal, relaxed, and funny. Tolle makes people laugh at themselves, with the result being powerfully effective therapy. <i>Living a Life of Inner Peace</i> records one of Tolle's most moving, transformative talks. For those new to his teachings, this is an ideal introduction. Those familiar with his work, including the bestsellers <i>The Power of Now</i> and <i>Stillness Speaks,</i> should be prepared for something extraordinary.</p><p>Eckhart Tolle is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The Power of Now (translated into 33 languages) and A New Earth, which are widely regarded as two of the most influential spiritual books of our time. In 2008, A New Earth became the first spiritual book to be selected for Oprah&#39;s Book Club as well as the subject of a ten-week online workshop co-taught by Eckhart and Oprah.Listening to a recording of a live presentation can be frustrating, at times leaving one with a sense of missing something by not being in the audience. Although there is some sense of that in this talk, it is far overshadowed by Tolle's message and the advantage of being able to queue up the CDs and listen again. His informal, relaxed style includes plenty of humor and personal stories. At the core of his discussion is a profound and compelling simplicity. He is also easy to understand as he makes his ideas clear without condescension. J.E.M. � AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Invention of Wings</h2><p>Invention of Wings</p><p>In the early 1830s, Sarah Grimk� and her younger sister, Angelina, were the most infamous women in America. They had rebelled so vocally against their family, society, and their religion that they were reviled, pursued, and exiled from their home city of Charleston, South Carolina, under threat of death. Their crime was speaking out in favor of liberty and equality and for African American slaves and women, arguments too radically humanist even for the abolitionists of their time. Their lectures drew crowds of thousands, even (shockingly, then) men, and their most popular pamphlet directly inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>--published 15 years later. These women took many of the first brutal backlashes against feminists and abolitionists, but even their names are barely known now. Sue Monk Kidd became fascinated by these sisters, and the question of what compelled them to risk certain fury and say with the full force of their convictions what others had not (or could not). She discovered that in 1803, when Sarah turned 11, her parents gave her the &#x201c;human present&#x201d; of 10-year-old Hetty to be her handmaid, and Sarah taught Hetty to read, an act of rebellion met with punishment so severe that the slave girl died of "an unspecified disease" shortly after her beating. Kidd knew then that she had to try to bring Hetty back to life (&#x201c;I would imagine what might have been," she tells us), and she starts these girls' stories here, both cast in roles they despise. She trades chapters between their voices across decades, imagining the Grimk� sisters&#x2019; courageous metamorphosis and, perhaps more vitally, she gives Hetty her own life of struggle and transformation. Few characters have ever been so alive to me as Hetty and Sarah. Long after you finish this book, you'll feel its courageous heart beating inside your own. -- <em>Mari Malcolm</em>Sue Monk Kidd is the author of three novels, all of which have been international bestsellers: The Secret Life Of Bees, The Mermaid Chair and The Invention Of Wings.

There isn&#x2019;t a single thing I&#x2019;ve done, or experienced,&#x201d; said Grant Wood, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s been even the least bit exciting.&#x201d; <br><br>Wood was one of America&#x2019;s most famous regionalist painters; to love his work was the equivalent of loving America itself. In his time, he was an &#x201c;almost mythical figure,&#x201d; recognized most supremely for his hard-boiled farm scene, <i>American Gothic</i>, a painting that has come to reflect the essence of America&#x2019;s traditional values&#x2014;a simple, decent, homespun tribute to our lost agrarian age. <br><br>In this major new biography of America&#x2019;s most acclaimed, and misunderstood, regionalist painter, Grant Wood is revealed to have been anything but plain, or simple . . . <br><br>R. Tripp Evans reveals the true complexity of the man and the image Wood so carefully constructed of himself. Grant Wood called himself a farmer-painter but farming held little interest for him. He appeared to be a self-taught painter with his scenes of farmlands, farm workers, and folklore but he was classically trained, a sophisticated artist who had studied the Old Masters and Flemish art as well as impressionism. He lived a bohemian life and painted in Paris and Munich in the 1920s, fleeing what H. L. Mencken referred to as &#x201c;the booboisie&#x201d; of small-town America. <br><br>We see Wood as an artist haunted and inspired by the images of childhood; by the complex relationship with his father (stern, pious, the &#x201c;manliest of men&#x201d;); with his sister and his beloved mother (Wood shared his studio and sleeping quarters with his mother until her death at seventy-seven; he was forty-four). <br><br>We see Wood&#x2019;s homosexuality and how his studied masculinity was a ruse that shaped his work.<br><br>Here is Wood&#x2019;s life and work explored more deeply and insightfully than ever before. Drawing on letters, the artist&#x2019;s unfinished autobiography, his sister&#x2019;s writings, and many never-before-seen documents, Evans&#x2019;s book is a dimensional portrait of a deeply complicated artist who became a &#x201c;National Symbol.&#x201d; It is as well a portrait of the American art scene at a time when America&#x2019;s Calvinistic spirit and provincialism saw Europe as decadent and artists were divided between red-blooded patriotic men and &#x201c;hothouse aesthetes.&#x201d; <br><br>Thomas Hart Benton said of Grant Wood: &#x201c;When this new America looks back for landmarks to help gauge its forward footsteps, it will find a monument standing up in the midst of the wreckage . . . This monument will be made out of Grant Wood&#x2019;s works.&#x201d;</p><p>R. Tripp Evans is Professor of Art History at Wheaton College in Massachusetts. He is the author of <i>Romancing the Maya: Mexican Antiquity in the American Imagination, 1820-1915 </i>(2004). He received his doctoral degree in the history of art from Yale University and has served as a visiting lecturer at Yale, Wellesley College, and Brown University. He and his partner, Ed Cabral, live in Providence, Rhode Island.&nbsp;Sometime in the late 1930s, Grant Wood confided to his sister that he had a double. Mistaken for the artist by Wood's lifelong friends and even his Aunt Jeanette, this shadowy figure had appeared as far away as Omaha and as uncomfortably close as the painter's home in Iowa City. The story of Wood's doppelg�nger appears only briefly in his sister Nan's memoirs &#x2014; the reference is casual, the mystery left unsolved &#x2014; yet it raises related questions about the impression Wood made on those who knew him best, and reveals, to use Nan's words, one of the many "strange by-products" of her brother's fame. Typically more amused than alarmed by his own celebrity, Wood confessed that in this instance "the matter makes me feel a little queer."<br><br> The fact that a stranger could have fooled the artist's family and friends so easily may be explained, in part, by their occasional inability to recognize Wood himself. As the painter related in his unfinished autobiography, his father sometimes failed to register Wood's presence even when the two stood in the same room. Similarly, following the artist's return from a summer in Paris in 1920, his neighbors in Cedar Rapids claimed not to recognize the man they'd known for decades. Even Wood's mother, who lived with him until her death at 77, could not identify her son when presented with a recent photograph of him in 1929.<br><br> Wood fared little better with the general public. His popular image as the Artist-in-Overalls allowed Wood to simply vanish when he appeared in his street clothes; despite ubiquitous images of the artist that had appeared in the national press, a reporter in 1938 noted that Wood "can spend two hours in Union Station in Kansas City without exciting any notice at all." Such an uncanny talent for blending into the woodwork &#x2014; reflected, rather fittingly, in Wood's brief stint as a camouflage artist during the First World War &#x2014; was matched by a lifelong habit of self-deprecation. In a typical interview at the height of his fame, Wood claimed: "I'm the plainest kind of fellow you can find. There isn't a single thing I've done, or experienced, that's been even the least bit exciting."<br><br> Countless profiles of the artist in the 1930s celebrated his very ordinariness as the source of his work's appeal. For these critics, Wood's life and imagery appeared to reflect the values of a similarly unassuming, and now vanished, rural American Golden Age &#x2014; a period untainted by the complexities and strident individualism of the modern world. &nbsp;In 1936, the <i>Daily Iowan </i>went so far as to print a scientific recording of Wood's brainwaves; as uniform and predictable as a sine curve, the painter's "large, regular, and smooth" brainwaves -&nbsp;whose pattern, indeed, bore a striking resemblance to the rolling hills of his landscapes - were favorably compared with the "irregular and more complicated" brainwaves of a psychology professor at the University of Iowa. &nbsp;Wood's physiological makeup, it seems, represented as much of an historical throwback as his work did. <br><br> Critics in our own time have often perpetuated this two-dimensional image of the artist, yet even the most cursory investigation of Wood's life calls into question its supposedly uncomplicated character. Not only do we encounter a self-proclaimed "farmer-painter" who never farmed, but a young man whose earliest vocations lay in the fields of jewelry design, interior decoration, and theatrical production. Faced with Wood's public reputation as a na�ve, parochial artist, moreover, we must account for his early training in a prestigious French at�lier, his ambitious one-man d�but in a Paris gallery, and his careful study of Old Master paintings. Finally, we must reconcile this apparent paragon of such "heartland" values as civic virtue and traditional Christian morality, with a man who often bristled at small town life, belonged to no church, and spent most of his life masking &#x2014; not always successfully &#x2014; his homosexuality.<br><br> Wanda Corn claims that "it has been Grant Wood's fate to be widely known but narrowly understood," yet I would argue that he is every bit as narrowly known as he is understood. Conservative champions applaud the painter as a folksy chronicler of a by-gone America, or a gentle satirist of small-town foibles, whereas his detractors claim (for the very same reasons) that he promoted a cloying, phony, or even sinister form of nationalism. Whether sympathetic or hostile to the artist's work, both camps miss the man who stands before them &#x2014; and certainly, they fail to account for the arresting elements that haunt his imagery.<br> Wood's subtly distorted figures and tumescent landscapes, his esoteric and sometimes intentionally incorrect historical quotations, as well as his unsettling juxtapositions of scale, place, and time all belie his work's presumed legibility and communal spirit. Indeed, if we stop to consider some of the paintings for which he is best known &#x2014; works like <i>American Gothic</i> (1930), <i>Victorian Survival</i> (1931), or <i>Parson Weems' Fable</i> (1939) &#x2014; it is clear that his most successful images are also among his most unnerving and impenetrable. First-time viewers of these paintings often find it difficult to reconcile their immediate emotional response with the scenes before their eyes, and with good reason. Tickling our subconscious in unexpected ways, these images appear to provide a rather startling view of the artist's, as well.<br><br> <i>American Gothic</i> perfectly illustrates this phenomenon. Although the painting is often interpreted as an unmediated reflection of rural American values, most viewers feel neither warm nostalgia nor smug contempt when they first encounter the picture. Rather, they experience an indefinable dread. For a whole host of reasons, <i>American Gothic</i> is a profoundly creepy image &#x2014; "or it can be," as Steven Biel suggested in his 2005 study of the painting, "if you look at it carefully."<br> The work's extraordinary fame, of course, has made it difficult for anyone to properly see it. Its composition has become an almost instantly recognizable sight gag &#x2014; after the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, it may be the most parodied painting in the history of art &#x2014; yet it is the rare viewer who can name its maker, determine its subject, or even identify the intended relationship between its figures (most audiences assume that the pair represents a married couple, but the artist himself insisted they were a father and daughter &#x2014; a factor that, in and of itself, considerably complicates the work). Not only do <i>American Gothic</i>'s innumerable recastings obscure the artist along with his intentions, but they also banish the original work's palpable sense of confrontation. It is easier by far &#x2014; a great relief, in fact &#x2014; to see the likes of Paris Hilton, Paul Newman, or the latest lampooned politician holding the farmer's menacing pitchfork.<br><br> To understand the discomfort that <i>American Gothic</i> inspires, we must strip away its parodies and reproductions and consider, instead, the unique circumstances of its creation and creator. "Every masterpiece came into the world with a measure of ugliness," Gertrude Stein once wrote; "[Raphael's] <i>Sistine Madonna</i> is all over the world, on grocer's calendars and on Christmas cards; everyone thinks it's an easy picture. It's our business as critics to stand in front of it and recover its ugliness." The "ugliness" Stein perceives in the <i>Sistine Madonna</i>, and that we may find in abundance in Wood's imagery, has less to do with notions of beauty or design than it does with the works' potential to move viewers in unexpected ways. By recovering this dimension of Wood's art we not only better understand the man himself, but we also rescue his remarkable works from the charge (or the accolade) that they are in some way "easy" pictures.<br><br> Rather than presenting Wood and his work as paradigms of Depression-era America, as so many have done, this study seeks to illuminate the profound and fertile <i>dis</i>connection between the artist and his period. More particularly, I am interested in the ambivalence Wood felt toward his native environment, and in the ways his allegiance to Regionalism &#x2014; the movement with which he is most often associated &#x2014; served important private and immediate ends, rather than political or cultural ones. As if by pentimento, I hope to reveal the indelible traces of desire, memory, and dread that lie just beneath the surfaces of his work &#x2014; elements that have little, if anything, to do with national character.<br><br> Even more so than any of his critics, it is Wood himself who has hampered our full understanding of his art and its motivations. Throughout his life he attempted to present himself and his work as the reflection of "authentic" American manhood &#x2014; conceived as heterosexual, hardworking, wholesome, and patriotic &#x2014; precisely because he believed he had fallen short of this model himself. Not only did Wood fail to achieve his father's rather daunting model of masculinity, but his short-lived "bohemian" period in the 1920s also inspired chronic suspicions concerning his character, associations, and private life. The defensive, all-American image Wood adopted in response to this scrutiny has provided as much relief to his promoters as it has fodder for his critics, yet it has also led to their rather meager harvest from his work. If we are to make better sense of his imagery, then it is our business to recapture the compelling "ugliness" in his work &#x2014; to borrow Stein's phrase &#x2014; and to restore it, as well, to the man himself.</p><h2>The Vanished Bride (Bront� Sisters Mystery, A)</h2><p><b>Before they became legendary writers, Charlotte Bront�, Emily Bront�, and Anne Bront� were&nbsp;<i>detectors </i>in this charming historical mystery...</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Yorkshire, 1845.

Now Emily, Anne and Branwell were all gone to a better place, and for the sister left behind this mortal existence was almost unbearably lonely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet...</p><p>Charlotte&#x2019;s mouth curled into a small echo of a smile as she remembered what adventures they had forged together, the dangers they had faced, the shocking revelations they had uncovered, and the secrets they kept.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the fashionable drawing rooms of London to the soir�es of New York, the world had talked about &#x201c;those Bront� women&#x201c;, who had wrought such passion and pride on the page. At first some doubted they were men, then others refused to believe they could be women.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it made Charlotte smile to think how very little of the truth those people knew. How very little of what she and her sisters truly were.<br><br></p><p>Now her sisters and her brother Branwell were all dead. Not another living soul on this earth knew <i>everything</i>. Not one memory of the wonders and the horrors that they had discovered for themselves had ever been committed to paper, and any correspondence that might have revealed them, had been meticulously burned by Charlotte herself.</p><p>When one day it would become Charlotte&#x2019;s turn to join her siblings in God&#x2019;s grace, all that had happened in those few glorious, thrilling years &#x2013; the last years that they would be together &#x2013; would die with her. No one would ever know of their adventures. Outside that very pane of glass that shook and trembled in its frame as she sat alone at the table, a universe of humanity gusted as hard as the wind in a ceaseless vortex of life and death. And all you needed in order to uncover its darkest secrets was to know exactly where to look.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might even be said, Charlotte thought to herself with a smile, as her nib finally joined with paper and she began to forge worlds out of ink, that none had ever lived such adventurous, dangerous and exciting lives as those three women who grew up in a village no one had ever heard of, on the edge of the windswept and desolate moor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those were secrets that would never be told, but oh, what wonderful secrets they were.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Prologue</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The first thing Matilda French saw was the blood. There was such a quantity of it that for several moments she couldn&#x2019;t make sense of the blackish pool of liquid that was spreading slowly under the closed door, not until the iron scent hit her, and she was reminded at once of the day her mother died, and the smell of her blood mingled with freshly cut violets.</p><p>Only then did the inevitable violence of what she was looking at begin to make sense of itself, the realisation that <i>something</i> dreadful had happened creeping through her veins like an infection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, it was so unexpected, so strange to make such a discovery in the perfect quiet of a pre-dawn house, that at first she did not scream, she did not faint. Shock held her captive and as if mesmerised into a trance-like state, body separated from mind, she did what she always did not knowing what else to do; she knocked twice on the door.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Madam?&#x2019; The boards were sticky underfoot, the room still dark and full of shadows. Dawn had yet to lighten the sky outside. Her voice was barely more than a whisper, her next words made little sense in the face of such horror. &#x2018;Mrs Chester, are you well?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she pushed the door open she found the room silent and empty of its occupant, and covered in so much blood that she felt she might drown simply by inhaling.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As her eyes adjusted to the light she could make out that her mistress&#x2019;s bed was empty, though from the head to the foot it was covered in what looked like one great ink stain, spreading outwards from the centre like a monstrous butterfly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trembling, breath held, Mattie crossed to the window, where she dragged open the heavy curtains, and loosened the window latch to let some of the damp, cold air in, sucking it in desperately. The first thin light of morning cast its veil over the room, and when finally she turned back to the bed, Mattie understood the terrible truth of what she was seeing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Haworth 1845</b></p><p><b>Charlotte</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>&#x2018;You cannot just stop, Emily,&#x2019; Charlotte half-chided, half-laughed, as she stumbled into the back of her taller sister, &#x2018;There is neither the room, nor the time for stopping.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had become the sisters&#x2019; ritual in recent weeks, this circular walk about the dining-room table, talking out their ideas, spinning them into thin air until they could see the words forming over their heads, lit by firelight and shaped by smoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not a grand dining room: if anything it was rather cramped, almost entirely filled with the pretty table, and a rather worn, black sofa. Charlotte had chosen the wallpaper, in dusky shades of pink and grey, as modest and muted as the plumage of a pigeon. On the wall hung a portrait of Lord Horatio Nelson, national hero, and military genius, still adored in the Parsonage forty years after his glorious death in battle. Charlotte liked to think of him looking down his splendid nose at them, keeping watch on all their coming and goings; she found it&nbsp; comforting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I had a thought, Charlotte.&#x2019; Emily turned slightly to look at her sister over her shoulder with her enviable grey-blue eyes. &#x2018;Yes, and a good one too, so good that I must write it down at once before it escapes me. Move.&#x2019;</p><p>Charlotte watched in horror as Emily scribbled her&nbsp; nib furiously on a sheet of blotting paper, placed directly on the polished surface of the table.</p><p>&#x2018;Really, Emily,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Have you not vandalised this table enough? Poor Aunt Branwell would be turning in her grave if she could see how easily you disregard half a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of bees wax and elbow grease.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Charlotte, it is many years since the &#x2018;E&#x2019; incident, and I <i>was</i> only a child&#x2019; Emily replied, obligingly moving the blotting paper onto her writing slope never-the-less. Charlotte watched as her sister&#x2019;s thumb searched out the initial, scratched crudely into the surface with a fruit knife many years ago, giving it a rub as if for good luck. &#x2018;Some might say that carving my initial into the table was a form of ornamentation...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Aunt Branwell wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x2019; Anne said mildly, not looking up from the newspaper that she was engrossed in. &#x2018;Do you remember Charlotte? Emily did her best to hide the transgression by refusing to move her hand for an entire morning? How Aunt Branwell howled when she saw what she had done!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I seem to recall that Papa was quite impressed with me,&#x2019; Emily muttered, already half lost to her writing.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x2018;We may count ourselves most fortunate that we have a father so devoted to our enlightenment that a scratched table-top is not nearly so&nbsp; important to him as his daughter learning to make her letters,&#x2019; Charlotte said fondly. &#x2018;Another Papa would have beaten you soundly, as our Aunt surely would have liked to, don&#x2019;t you think Anne?&#x2019; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desperate for distraction, Charlotte did her best to catch Anne&#x2019;s eye but her youngest sister was not to be moved from her reading. With only Anne&#x2019;s little dog Flossy joining in the parade Charlotte, sighing heavily, walked on alone, with only Anne&#x2019;s little dog Flossy joining in the parade, jealously observing as Emily scored her letters into her paper with the same furious energy and impatience with which she greeted much of life. If only Charlotte could find the same kind of inspiration to turn her mind away from the great unhappiness that preoccupied it, if only she could tempt her sisters to distract her with talk.</p><p>She should be content, happy even. For it had been many years since all of them lived under the same beloved roof. The fire burnt merrily in the grate, casting a warm dancing light on the walls, the snug and slightly smoky little room illuminated only a little further by the single oil lamp. Outside the rain came hard, flung into the rectory windows like handfuls of pebbles. Below them Haworth huddled against the cruel wind.</p><p>It was a typical Yorkshire summer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Nothing comes this evening,&#x2019; Charlotte sighed in frustration, stopping to look at the crowd of gravestones that tumbled headlong down the hillside towards the church and town beyond, as if the dead were in a hurry to return home. &#x2018;My head is as empty as a blank page, and just as useless. There is far too much &#x2013; <i>feeling</i> &#x2013; getting in the way of <i>thinking</i>. To even compose two good lines seems impossible to me.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Then perhaps you should try thinking in feelings,&#x2019; Emily said unhelpfully, as the words poured from the nib of her quill, in the chaotic and ink-spattered scrawl that drove neat Charlotte to despair. Page after effortless page of jealously guarded verse filled Emily&#x2019;s notebooks.</p><p>&#x2018;<i>You </i>may still find endless inspiration in childish fantasy, Emily,&#x2019; Charlotte snapped back before she could stop herself. &#x2018;But <i>I</i> have grown out of our fantasy worlds of Gondal and Angria. Mine is a life burdened with more mature concerns.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Mature concerns&#x2019; is a very novel way of describing &#x2018;love sick,&#x2019; Emily muttered, without looking up. &#x2018;And I care not what you think of me, Charlotte for the Gondals are in the midst of The First Wars, and I must bring them to victory or many will perish.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You are impossible Emily,&#x2019; Charlotte said, but with little venom. In truth she longed for the days when she was more like her sister, for wherever Emily walked, wherever she looked, Gondal formed all about her, its people meaning as much to her, if not more, than those made of flesh and blood with beating hearts. Her imagination was her freedom, Charlotte thought enviously, wishing that she too was able to leave behind the ceaseless hurt of this mundane, earthly existence for a world where all turned on her command. In that world, her heart would never be broken.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Stop and rest, dear Charlotte,&#x2019; Anne said, as she set her paper down at last, regarding Charlotte with such sympathy that it felt almost unbearable to be pitied so. Charlotte knew that Anne would never mention that name, and Charlotte made a point to never speak it aloud. Even so it resounded constantly within her.</p><p>&#x2018;Come sit with me, and read <i>The</i> <i>Times </i>of London, it is only a few days old and there is much of interest.

Can you imagine, the other side of the world in less than a fortnight?&#x2019; Anne paused for a moment, her pretty eyes shining at the thought of adventure, before turning the page. &#x2018;And see here, it seems that for three years now in London there have been eight specially trained and educated policeman engaged ...</p></p><h2>A Way in the World: A Novel</h2><p>In his long-awaited, vastly innovative new novel, Naipaul, &#34;one of literature&#39;s great travelers&#34; (Los Angles Times), spans continents and centuries to create what is at once an autobiography and a fictional archaeology of colonialism. &#34;Dickensian . . . a brilliant new prism through which to view (Naipaul&#39;s) life and work.&#34;--New York Times.</p><p>V.S. Naipaul was born in Trinidad in 1932. He came to England on a scholarship in 1950. He spent four years at University College, Oxford, and began to write, in London, in 1954. He pursued no other profession.<br> &nbsp;<br> His novels include <i>A House for Mr Biswas</i>, <i>The Mimic Men</i>, <i>Guerrillas</i>, <i>A Bend in the River</i>, and <i>The Enigma of Arrival</i>. In 1971 he was awarded the Booker Prize for <i>In a Free State</i>. His works of nonfiction, equally acclaimed, include <i>Among the Believers</i>, <i>Beyond Belief</i>, <i>The Masque of Africa</i>, and a trio of books about India: <i>An Area of Darkness</i>, <i>India: A Wounded Civilization</i> and <i>India: A Million Mutinies Now</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> In 1990, V.S. Naipaul received a knighthood for services to literature; in 1993, he was the first recipient of the David Cohen British Literature Prize. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001. He lived with his wife Nadira and cat Augustus in Wiltshire, and died in 2018.This work of ``fiction'' from Naipaul (The Enigma of Arrival, 1993, etc.) is really a label-defying tapestry of elements, a fascinating, closely woven blend of history, character study, and autobiography. Naipaul's wonderfully vivid, lyrical descriptions of Trinidad, his homeland, reflect a mind whose every experience seems to have been carefully captured in amber. The theme that repeats throughout is the shifting nature of reality as it is refracted through the eyes and thoughts of those who shaped Trinidadian and South American colonial history--and those who fumble for identity in its aftermath. Naipaul struggles to imagine an earlier, aboriginal Trinidad that preceded the villages and sugar-cane fields and coconut estates of his childhood, attempting to grasp a sense of history that he never felt growing up in the voided legacy of colonialism: The ``idea of a background--and what it contained: order and values and the possibility of striving: perfectibility- -made sense only when people were more truly responsible for themselves. We weren't responsible in that way. Much had been taken out of our hands. We didn't have backgrounds. We didn't have a past.... We were just there, floating.'' Naipaul dissects the dreams and the realities of Spanish and British imperialism, examining ``impresarios of revolution'' such as Venezuelan conqueror Francisco Miranda, whose New World visions included ``fantasies of Incas worthy of Plato's republic, fantasies which (like Columbus's ideas about the New World, and Raleigh's) also contained a dream of a fabulous personal authority.'' By individualizing the colonial and postcolonial experience, Naipaul reveals its human roots: the restless search for identity, for a sense of completion, that drove conquerors and conquered alike--that, as Naipaul tells us, drove him to become a writer. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In <i>The Beautiful Cure</i>, leading immunologist Daniel M. Davis describes how the scientific quest to understand how the immune system works&#x2014;and how it is affected by stress, sleep, age, and our state of mind&#x2014;is now unlocking a revolutionary new approach to medicine and well-being.<br><br> The body&#x2019;s ability to fight disease and heal itself is one of the great mysteries and marvels of nature. But in recent years, painstaking research has resulted in major advances in our grasp of this breathtakingly beautiful inner world: a vast and intricate network of specialist cells, regulatory proteins, and dedicated genes that are continually protecting our bodies. Far more powerful than any medicine ever invented, the immune system plays a crucial role in our daily lives. We have found ways to harness these natural defenses to create breakthrough drugs and so-called immunotherapies that help us fight cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and many age-related diseases, and we are starting to understand whether activities such as mindfulness might play a role in enhancing our physical resilience.<br><br> Written by a researcher at the forefront of this adventure, <i>The Beautiful Cure</i> tells a dramatic story of scientific detective work and discovery, of puzzles solved and mysteries that linger, of lives sacrificed and saved. With expertise and eloquence, Davis introduces us to this revelatory new understanding of the human body and what it takes to be healthy.</p><p><b>Daniel M. Davis</b> is professor of immunology at the University of Manchester in the UK. He is the author of <i>The Compatibility Gene: How Our Bodies Fight Disease, Attract Others, and Define Our Selves</i>, which was picked by Bill Bryson for the <i>Guardian&#x2019;</i>s<i></i>Books of the Year feature."<i>The Beautiful Cure</i> . . . focuses on the science of immunology itself, taking us through the evolution of the discipline and the stories behind key advances in the field. . . . Davis conveys a visceral appreciation for how messy, and how human, medical science can be." (David A. Shaywitz <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"Davis leaves readers with a reminder that, for all the scientific innovations described here, the human immune system remains 'far more powerful than any medicine we have devised,' and that sleep, healthy eating, mindfulness, and other complementary practices all appear to help. A modern equivalent of Paul de Kruif&#x2019;s 1926 classic, <i>Microbe Hunters</i>, Davis&#x2019;s work is concise and illuminating." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Davis endeavors to tell the story of human immunology in eight chapters, spanning foundational concepts, pivotal discoveries by brilliant scientists and their collaborators, the personal drama that has accompanied Nobel prizes and other recognition awarded in this highly competitive field, and anecdotes about how individual choices can affect one&#x2019;s immune function and overall health. . . . A heroic effort. . . . The relatively brief overview reveals intriguing connections in immunology&#x2019;s history, helps tie together stove-piped areas of inquiry, and offers fresh perspective on future research strategies." (Audrey R. Glynn <i>Science</i>)<br><br>"Refreshingly sober. . . . Intelligent and insightful." (Jerome Groopman <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Davis came to immunology from physics and, like visions of outer space, his picture of the human immune system&#x2014;the little we actually know of it&#x2014;is dizzying, intriguing, and strange. . . . Emphasizing that &#x2018;no scientist is an island,&#x2019; Davis follows the strings of achievements and failures (always at least as valuable as the successes) that have led to radical reinterpretations of how the immune system works. His explanations are rich in technical detail, but always clear: as he recreates the revelatory moments in the labs, he puts the reader right there at the microscope, on the edge of discovery. I was surprised how quickly I became (temporarily) fluent in the language of dendritic cells, receptors, cytokines, and so on. Davis also clearly defines more familiar terms such as interferons and interleukins, explains cortisol&#x2019;s effects and how it&#x2019;s related to cortisone, and flags the truly revolutionary insights in this history of sometimes baffling eureka moments." (Laurie G. <i>Politics and Prose, "Staff Picks"</i>)<br><br>"Davis deftly sketches the history of immune science and the surprising discoveries made by scientists who were initially ridiculed by their peers&#x2014;the man who first named interferon, an antiviral agent in the blood, was met with disbelief by colleagues who jokingly called it &#x2018;misinterpreton.&#x2019; Today, scientists are successfully tinkering with our natural immune response in the molecular equivalent of taking the brakes off, so that our hunter-killer cells launch war against tumors." (<i>Telegraph, "Best Books of 2018"</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Beautiful Cure</i> sets the stage for a coming revolution in immunology, with fascinating stories of how researchers solved puzzles they didn&#x2019;t know existed." (Jeremy Webb <i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br>"A terrific book by a consummate storyteller and scientific expert considers the past and future of the body&#x2019;s ability to fight disease and heal itself. . . . We should all pay more attention to understanding the barricades that evolution has provided us with, that we have learned to train, because this war is endless. <i>The Beautiful Cure </i>is a worthy guide." (Adam Rutherford <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>"Five stars. We all think we know, at a rough level, how the immune system works. Cells in the blood identify foreign invaders and go into battle with them. Inflammation and perhaps a fever develop, and eventually the body destroys the illegal immigrants. From then on their card is marked: the system remembers the microscopic terrorists, and if they ever reappear they are ganged up on and eliminated immediately. That&#x2019;s immunity. In recent decades, though, the scientific picture has become hugely more complicated, as the immunologist Davis relates in this elegantly concise book." (Steven Poole <i>Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"Davis&#x2019;s wonderful book <i>The Beautiful Cure </i>recounts how research into the immune system in recent decades has resulted in what amounts to a health revolution. Immunotherapy drugs are now worth billions of dollars, and cancers and autoimmune diseases that were once considered untreatable can now be fought and, in a few cases, even cured. There is little doubt that there will be further progress in the years to come. Davis recounts in exceptionally clear and sympathetic prose how all this came about."

Nightmare vied with banality: the severed leg of a policeman rotted in the gutter, half covered by a girlie magazine, blood-speckled pages fluttering in the evening breeze. <br>Just hours before, downtown Hanoi had been hit by four dozen bombs and missiles launched from a wave of Chinese aircraft. The daytime attack had pockmarked the already battered city, starting fires and destroying several buildings. The fires burned largely unabated. The relief forces were drained, and much of their equipment was exhausted as well. A number of fire trucks and ambulances had been damaged by the bombings; a few sat crushed by debris from the buildings they had tried to save. Others sat abandoned where they had run out of fuel. Fire trucks and ambulances still operating no longer used their sirens, as if they were too weak even to sound an alarm. <br>The center of town had been hit hard. The former French-dot-com bank, once a landmark, was now a burned-out hulk. A residential high-rise not far away had lost about a third of its tower; in the dimming light the jagged edges of bricks looked like an arm rising from the earth, about to rake its claws on the city. <br>And yet, despite the destruction, the city continued to struggle on, its breath labored yet real. Elements of the bizarre mixed with the defiant and practical. In the same street where citizens had cowered in basements and behind whatever thin shelter they could find an hour before, a parade of black Korean limousines now delivered elegant matrons and twenty-something <i>fashionistas</i> to the Ambasario Hotel for an annual benefit for Hanoi orphans. The women wore brilliantly colored dresses, their hot pink and fuchsia silks a militant stance against the Chinese onslaught. <br>Zeus Murphy stopped on the street to let a pair of women pass. The soldier felt like a misplaced voyeur, an uninvited guest at a private carnival. He was certainly an outsider&#x2014;a U.S. Army major dropped into the middle of an exotic land&#x2014;though he was also more of a participant in the war than any of the dozens of people walking past him in the street. <br>Zeus watched the women pick up the skirts of their dresses and step over the dried splatters of blood as they walked across the concrete apron to the hotel&#x2019;s front door. A path had been swept clear for them; a small pile of glass lay a few feet from Zeus&#x2019;s boots, the fragments glittering with the hint of light from the hotel&#x2019;s interior. <br>Most of the women were ex-pats, the spouses and, in a few cases, daughters of men working in Hanoi or nearby. Zeus wondered if they had come out in defiance or to seek some sort of solidarity in misery. There was no longer a reliable route of escape for civilians from the city or the country. Air transport was close to impossible; commercial flights had ended the day before, not only out of Hanoi but also Saigon much farther south. (Saigon was what everyone except foreigners called Ho Chi Minh City.) Even the American embassy had difficulty arranging for helicopters, although it had two flights scheduled for later that day. <br>The highways south and the sea ports were still open, though how long that would last was anyone&#x2019;s guess. <br>Realizing he was late, Zeus started forward, only to bump into a woman who&#x2019;d been trying to squeeze past him on the pavement. The woman jerked her head around and put up her hands. He reached to grab her, thinking she was going to fall. <br>She staggered back, regaining her balance. The look on her face was one of dread, as if she had been touched by a ghoul. <br>Zeus put up his hands, motioning that he meant no harm. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s OK,&#x201d; he told her in English. He searched for the Vietnamese words for <i>sorry</i> amid his scant vocabulary. <br> <i>&#x201c;Xin loi,&#x201d;</i> he told her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Excuse me.&#x201d; <br>She took another step, then turned and walked quickly toward the hotel, her pace just under a trot. <br>Zeus waited until she reached the door before starting again. He, too, was going to the hotel, though not for the show. He had to meet someone in the bar. <br>Two women dressed in plain gray pantsuits, neither much younger than fifty, stood at the doorway to the lobby. They had AK-47s in their hands. Zeus nodded as he approached. His white face made it clear that he was a foreigner&#x2014;and not Chinese&#x2014;and that was all the pass he needed to get in. <br>At the very start of the war, the Vietnamese had posted soldiers at the large hotels used by foreigners, more as a gesture of reassurance than security. The soldiers had long since been shifted to more important tasks. Some of the hotels had replaced them with their own security forces, though in most cases these men, too, had left, answering the call for citizens to report to local defense units, a kind of home guard that was organized around different residential areas in the city. Though trained in name only, some of these units had been transported farther north and west, to supplement regular army units facing the Chinese. <br>The units included women as well as men of all ages. Posters emblazoned with slogans like COURAGE and FIGHT ON were just now appearing on the walls of the city; the state television channel had broadcast interviews with women who had fought in the home guard during the last conflict with China. Some were now close to eighty; all said they were ready to fight again. <br>Zeus lowered his head as he passed a foreign camera crew standing at the end of the hallway. They had obviously come to record the charity event, but were being harangued by a hotel manager, who kept waving his hands in front of the cameraman&#x2019;s face. The journalist looked exasperated; he clearly had no idea why the man was objecting. <br>The hallway was dimly lit, with three of every four lightbulbs removed. People clustered along the sides. Many cupped cigarettes in their hands. Smoke hung heavy in the passage, adding to the shadows. It looked like a scene from a 1930s noir film: gangsters hiding at the far end of the hall, an undercover detective weaving through the unfamiliar darkness toward his fate. <br>Even in the mixed crowd of Westerners and Asians, Zeus looked out of place. His civilian jeans and casual collared T-shirt did little to disguise his military bearing. People glanced in his direction and made way. <br>The etched-glass door to the bar was blocked by a crowd of people on the other side. He pushed against it gently, gradually increasing pressure when they failed to move. <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said, in gruff English, pushing a little harder. He eased up and then jerked his hand so that the door banged against the bodies. Finally they got the message and began to part. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>The opening door caught</i> the eye of Ric Kerfer, who was sitting at the bar across the room, angled so he could see the doors without seeming to pay too much attention to them. His eyes sorted through the crowd, waiting to see if whoever was coming through was worth his interest. <br>Kerfer wasn&#x2019;t surprised that the bar was packed&#x2014;bars were always popular when the world was going to hell&#x2014;but it was interesting that there were so many foreigners still left in Hanoi. When he&#x2019;d left the week before, it seemed like everyone was angling for a way out. Now it looked like everyone wanted to stay and find out what the Chinese were really like. <br>Maybe it was this way on the <i>Titanic</i> as well. <br>Kerfer had been here for more than a half hour, nursing a single Jack Daniel&#x2019;s straight up. Ordinarily in that time he&#x2019;d have had four or five or six. But he&#x2019;d decided Vietnam was no longer a good place to get even mildly drunk. There was too much desperation in the air, too many people with little to lose. <br>That was when you had to keep your wits about you. The man pushed inexplicably past his breaking point by an accidental event was infinitely more dangerous than a soldier doing his duty. <br>Kerfer had felt the same sensation in Baghdad, in Yemen, in Syria. In Tripoli, he&#x2019;d sensed things were past the breaking point, and yet he&#x2019;d stayed on an extra day, wanting to make sure his job was truly done. It was a foolish bit of overzealousness that had almost cost him his life. <br>You had to do your duty. But your duty rarely called for you to die. Or rather, it called for you to die only under the most leveraged circumstances. Circumstances that Lieutenant Ric Kerfer, a United States Navy SEAL, could no longer imagine. <br>Kerfer leaned back on his barstool, recognizing Zeus. Right away he noticed that the Army major had changed. Part of it was physical&#x2014;Zeus was banged up. Kerfer could tell from the way he moved, shuffling the way an injured man did to divert attention from his injuries. <br>SEALs were always covering for some ligament strain or muscle tear, pretending they didn&#x2019;t need surgery that would end their time on the firing line. They might hold their shoulders in or be selective in how they leaned their weight, subtly trying to lessen the potential for more injury. <br>It had nothing to with pain, per se&#x2014;you got used to pain, unfortunately. It was more that you tried to keep whatever defect you&#x2019;d acquired from being seen. <br>But there was more than that. There was something now in Zeus&#x2019;s frown, something in the way he glared people out of his way. <br>Zeus Murphy was now an extremely dangerous man, Kerfer realized. More dangerous than the enemy. <br>He finished his drink, then pushed the glass toward the bartender. <br>&#x201c;Fill it,&#x201d; he told the man, a Vietnamese who spoke English well, though with a French accent. &#x201c;And draw a beer. I have a friend coming.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>Zeus spotted Kerfer</i> at the other end of the bar. He&#x2019;d grown to like the SEAL officer, even though like most SEALs Kerfer barely pretended to tolerate him. Kerfer&#x2019;s rank as a lieutenant was the equivalent of a captain in the Army, which meant that Zeus outranked him, but it was clear that rank had exactly zero meaning to Kerfer. <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said Zeus when he finally reached Kerfer. <br>&#x201c;Hey yourself, Major.&#x201d; <br>Zeus frowned at him. Kerfer smirked. <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t nobody in this place who can&#x2019;t figure out what the two of us are and who we work for,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;And not a one of them could give a shit. Here&#x2019;s a beer.&#x201d; <br>Zeus was surprised to find that not only the contents but the glass was cold. He took a drink; it was heady and seductive. <br>&#x201c;I heard you had some fun north of Haiphong,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re becoming a legend.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry&#x2019;s kinda pissed off I hear.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Screw him.&#x201d; Zeus ran his fingers along the outside of the glass; the cold felt almost exotic against the tips. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re coming over to the dark side, Major. Glad to have you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say my eyes are open. You talked to Perry?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He talked to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You told him we were meeting?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why would I do that?&#x201d; asked Kerfer. <br>Zeus suddenly felt wary. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you&#x2019;re back in Hanoi. I hear you&#x2019;re a wanted man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know they want me,&#x201d; said Kerfer. His men had killed a squad of Vietnamese soldiers who had strayed into their path while they were rescuing an American scientist from the Chinese&#x2014;at least that was Kerfer&#x2019;s version. The Vietnamese had protested vehemently to the ambassador and to Perry, both of whom had denied they had any knowledge of what had happened. <br>&#x201c;They wanted what I brought more than they wanted revenge,&#x201d; added Kerfer. &#x201c;Revenge isn&#x2019;t going to help them. Never helps anyone. Remember that, Major.&#x201d; <br>Kerfer was about the last person Zeus needed a lecture from. He changed the subject. &#x201c;You finished the shipments?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All done. I suspect they&#x2019;ve used them already.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So why are you still here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was told to sit and wait, in case I might be more useful in the future.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry said that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry&#x2019;s not my boss,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;He wants me out. He wants you out, too.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Zeus set down his glass. He glanced at it, and was surprised to see it was more than half gone. &#x201c;He told you that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He was in a talkative mood.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have something I wanted to ask you about,&#x201d; Zeus told Kerfer. <br>&#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a good place.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As good as any. Nobody&#x2019;s listening to us, Major. Look around.&#x201d; <br>Zeus shook his head. <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;Lead the way.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d have scouted out a place.&#x201d; <br>Kerfer laughed. &#x201c;Follow me.&#x201d; <br>The SEAL was a powerfully built man, with broad shoulders and legs that worked like piston rods. He exuded a certain don&#x2019;t-mess-with-me energy, and the crowd parted as he got up from his seat and led Zeus into a supply room at the back end of the bar. He didn&#x2019;t bother flipping on a light, and there was barely enough to see around the tall shelves of supplies as he walked to the back of the room. There he paused in front of a steel door; he fiddled with the knob for a moment, then pulled the door open, having picked the lock. Zeus hadn&#x2019;t even seen him take the lock-picking tools from his pocket. <br>&#x201c;Out here,&#x201d; Kerfer told him. <br>Zeus followed up a short flight of steps to a long, narrow corridor. A glass door, all but one of its panes missing, stood at the end. There was no doorknob on the inside; Kerfer reached through and took hold of the small handle to unlatch it. They emerged on a wide patio. <br>A man stood against the far rail, smoking a cigar. <br>&#x201c;Take a walk,&#x201d; Kerfer said to him in English. Then he added another few words in Vietnamese. <i>&#x201c;Bo?.&#x201d;</i> <br>The man frowned, but stuck the cigar in his mouth and left, going through the way they had just come. Kerfer, meanwhile, walked over to the edge of the patio, which was bounded by a short, thick wall. The space overlooked a yard paved with small stones that was part of the hotel restaurant&#x2019;s outdoor dining area; it was closed to patrons. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think <i>Bo?</i> really means <i>go</i>,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;More like &#x2018;abandon all hope ye who enter here.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your Vietnamese is getting better.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It gets the job done.&#x201d; <br>Zeus looked around. They were alone. <br>&#x201c;I need to get somebody out of the country,&#x201d; said Zeus. <br>&#x201c;Your girlfriend?&#x201d; <br>Zeus felt his cheeks warm. <br>&#x201c;Relax, Major, I&#x2019;m not your chaperone,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a crap about where you dip your wick.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Listen&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you throw her on a military transport? There&#x2019;s a helo coming into the embassy in a few hours.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perry won&#x2019;t go for it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a gofer. I bring things in, not take them out. When we left with the scientist, we had a destroyer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think I can bribe some of the people you&#x2019;re working with?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The nonmilitary people? Sure, you can bribe &#x2019;em.&#x201d; The SEAL rubbed his face. &#x201c;Whether they can help you or not is another question.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How much will they want?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The question is how much you can trust them,&#x201d; answered Kerfer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not paying attention. I&#x2019;d say the way things are going, nobody&#x2019;s going to be able to help you pretty soon. Where is she?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know for sure,&#x201d; said Zeus. &#x201c;A military prison. I&#x2019;m working on it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why is she in jail?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long story&nbsp;&#x2026; She saved the life of a POW that the Vietnamese wanted to kill. So she was arrested&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Save it,&#x201d; said Kerfer. &#x201c;Your best bet is to get her out on an embassy flight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That ain&#x2019;t gonna work.&#x201d; <br>Kerfer shrugged. He pushed off from the wall. <br>&#x201c;I have something else I need to talk about,&#x201d; said Zeus. <br>Kerfer stopped. <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I need to get in touch with your c...</p><h2>The Stone Wife (A Detective Peter Diamond Mystery)</h2><p>&#x201c;[W]onderful tidbits of Chaucerian scholarship enliven the novel.

Five-fifty. Six hundred. Six-fifty. Seven. Seven-fifty at the back. Eight.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bidding was keen by West Country standards. Morton&#x2019;s auction house in Bath was used to lots being knocked down without much show of enthusiasm. The dealer&#x2019;s faces were giving nothing away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;A thousand.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the increments would be in hundreds. Four or five bidders were still interested and Denis Doggart, the auctioneer, needed the help of his assistants to keep track of the small movements that signified bids.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Fifteen hundred. Sixteen. Seventeen on the phone.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heads turned. Not everyone in the room had realised bids were being phoned in. This wasn&#x2019;t a sale of impressionist paintings at Sotheby&#x2019;s. It was only the regular quarterly disposal of bits brought in to the Bath office for valuation, and most of them were bric-a-brac or tat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart was unfazed. He had been told to expect two telephone bidders, from New York and Tokyo.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Two thousand.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opening bidder shook his head. This was beyond his top figure. But the others were still in. The price mounted steadily, in two hundreds now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;At three thousand pounds.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stifled gasp came from the back where some onlookers had gathered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart knew who the main bidders were, except one, a dark-haired man in a cream coloured linen jacket and white shirt with a red bow tie. This stranger, more than anyone, was driving the sale. A spark of determination had kindled in his blue eyes. But who the hell was he? He&#x2019;d obviously registered and been given his number. He&#x2019;d shown no interest in any of the hundred and twenty-eight lots that had gone before. Doggart would have liked to check with his clerk to learn the name, but controlling the auction demanded total concentration. <br> After three thousand, the bidding is stepped up by larger amounts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Four thousand in the front.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bow Tie Man was in it to win it.<br> A pause.<br> &#x2018;All done?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from it. A new bidder raised his card, Sturgess, a London dealer who only made the trip to Bath when the catalogue contained something exceptional.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately Bow Tie topped the bid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest from Japan and America had ended somewhere between three and four thousand. Sturgess and the mystery man could settle this between them. And now the bids were coming in with the pendulum precision that auctioneers love.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Five thousand, then.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wears a bow tie these days? A few doctors and academics. The occasional eccentric. Certain auctioneers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment&#x2019;s consideration, Sturgess nodded for five thousand five.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No hesitation in the response.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Six thousand from the gentleman in the front. Are we there yet? A unique item of excellent provenance.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new, aggressive voice broke in: &#x2018;Nobody move.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shock in the room was unimaginable. When an auctioneer is at work, his voice and his alone is all anyone expects to hear. The bidding is silent. An utterance from anyone else is an outrage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If &#x201c;Nobody move&#x201d; was an order, it was not obeyed. After the collective jerk of surprise, all heads turned to see who had spoken.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A larger shock awaited. The speaker was wearing a black mask that covered his face and was holding a handgun. He must have been standing all the time against the wall within ten feet of the auctioneer. He&#x2019;d slipped on the mask and produced the gun and spoken his two words while all the attention was on the bidders.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denis Doggart, on his rostrum, was supposed to be directing the show. He turned his head and said, &#x2018;What&#x2019;s this about?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Shut up.&#x2019; The masked man said, &#x2018;Everyone stay right where you are and nobody will get hurt.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart said, &#x2018;This is intolerable.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I already told you to shut it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any doubt remained how serious the situation was, it evaporated when two more masked men with guns entered the saleroom by the door facing the rostrum. They marched up the aisle that was kept clear for safety reasons and took a grip on the handle of the wooden dolly supporting lot 129, the object currently under the hammer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was too much for the bidder with the red bow tie. &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t steal that,&#x2019; he said in a shrill, appalled voice. &#x2018;Get away.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Shut up, mister,&#x2019; the first gunman said. &#x2018;Get on with it,&#x2019; he told his companions.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s under auction. I made the last bid. No one is taking it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Let them be, sir,&#x2019; the auctioneer said. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re armed.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;They&#x2019;re not having it. It&#x2019;s too precious.&#x2019; Bow Tie was up from his chair and striding towards the men starting to shift the heavy burden. &#x2018;Get your hands off.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steady build-up of adrenalin during the auction must have given him extra courage, blind, foolhardy anger at the crime being committed in front of everyone. He was a slight man, no match for the crooks except in strength of will. He grabbed the sleeve of the nearest and succeeded in tugging his hand away from the dolly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gunman swung around. He had the automatic in his right hand. He levelled it and squeezed the trigger.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report echoed through the auction room, deafening everyone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The force of the bullet sent Bow Tie Man crashing against a walnut table stacked with china. He hit the ground at the same time as a mass of cups, saucers and plates. Pandemonium followed, screams and shouts, some people diving for cover, others heading for the door. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The would-be thieves panicked like everyone else. Any thoughts of stealing lot 129 were abandoned without a word passing among them. All three dashed for the exit, stepping over their wounded victim.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silver delivery van was waiting in the street outside with rear door open and a ramp in place. Two of the crooks dived in and hoisted the ramp aboard and the third slammed the door, dashed to the front and climbed in. The driver, obviously primed for the getaway, had the wheels in motion before the door closed. With a screech of rubber on tarmac, the getaway vehicle rounded the tight corners of Queen Square and was gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the auction room fumes of cordite hung in the air. People were kneeling beside the victim, wanting to assist, but a man shot through the belly needs more than first aid. Blood had seeped through his clothes and dribbled from his mouth. He had turned as grey as the lump of stone he&#x2019;d been bidding for.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Who is he?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No idea.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Doesn&#x2019;t anyone know who the poor guy is?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;He was bidding.

A forensics team was already at work in a cordoned area among the array of antique glass, silver and furniture. <br> There is only so much information you can get from looking at a shot corpse. Peter Diamond, Bath&#x2019;s head of CID, had now moved past and was taking more interest in lot 129. &#x2018;Someone was killed for <i>this</i>?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I know what you mean,&#x2019; Detective Sergeant Ingeborg Smith said. &#x2018;As a motive for murder, this tops everything.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Topped him, for sure.&#x2019; He passed his fingertips along the chipped surface. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not even in good condition.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s antique,&#x2019; Ingeborg said and added before realising he wasn&#x2019;t being serious, &#x2018;There are going to be signs of wear.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;As I say when I look in my shaving mirror each morning.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t.&#x2019; <br> &#x2018;Why would anyone want such a thing? It&#x2019;s not decorative. Would you give it house room?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Speaking personally, no, but people were bidding good money for it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Did you find out how much?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Six thousand and rising.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Six grand?&#x2019; Diamond said on a high note that startled the CSI team behind him. &#x2018;For this?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object in front of them, standing on a wooden dolly, was a slab of weathered stone about one metre in length, half a metre wide and as thick as a mattress. Whoever had lifted it on was probably nursing a back strain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Can you make out what it is?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it supposed to be someone on horseback?&#x2019; Ingeborg said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Looks to me like a bunch of bananas.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of the slab had been worked by a sculptor at some time in the remote past and any detail had long since been eroded. Thanks to the build-up of centuries of grime in the chiselled areas you could conceivably make out the outline of a horse and rider, Diamond was willing to admit. If so, the horse had thick legs, which was no bad thing. Either the sculptor&#x2019;s sense of proportion was faulty or the person in the saddle was an XXL.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Does the writing give any clues?&#x2019; he asked.<br> Along the base was some damaged lettering: &#x2018;. . . N&nbsp; . .&nbsp; AMB . . RE&nbsp; ES . . Y&nbsp; SHE&nbsp; SAT.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ingeborg shook her head. &#x2018;The last two words are all I can make out. I suppose they tell us the rider is female.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He eyed the carving again. &#x2018;You could have fooled me.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The auction catalogue may throw some light. There must be some about.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded. &#x2018;See if you can find one while I have a word with the pathologist.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bertram Sealy in his blue zip-suit was squatting in a mass of broken china beside the body and speaking into a tape-recorder. He flapped a hand as Diamond approached. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t come any closer with your big feet.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diamond let go of the do-not-cross tape as if he had never intended to creep under it. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not new to this. First impressions?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No great loss,&#x2019; the pathologist said.<br> There was a pause. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s callous even by your standards.&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;Bits of a tea service, cheap nineteen-fifties willow pattern.

Sealy&#x2019;s laborious efforts always put an extra strain on his dealings with Diamond. &#x2018;I was asking about the victim.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Him? He&#x2019;s beyond repair.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I can see that.

The towering triumph of the Lewis and Clark expedition is due in no small part to the skill and fortitude of such men as Sgt. Charles Floyd, the only expedition member to die; Sgt. Patrick Gass, who lived until 1870, the last surviving member of the expedition; Sgt. Nathaniel Hale Pryor, husband to an Osage woman; and York, Clark's slave, who was freed after the expedition. <p>The men who were instrumental to the success of the Lewis and Clark expedition come to life in this volume. Through the aid of a detailed biographical roster and a composite diary of the expedition that highlights the roles and actions of the expedition's members, Charles G. Clarke affords readers precious glimpses of those who have long stood in the shadows of Lewis and Clark. Disagreements and achievements, ailments and addictions, and colorful personalities and daily tasks are all vividly rendered in these pages. The result is an unforgettable portrait of the corps of diverse characters who undertook a remarkable journey across the western half of the continent almost two hundred years ago.</p></p><p>Born&nbsp;in 1899, Charles G. Clarke was an early pioneer of cinematography who won four Academy Award nominations. Dayton Duncan is the author of <i>Out West</i> and <i>Miles from Nowhere</i>, both available in Bison Books editions."Clarke's approach is a useful review of the daily challenges faced by the Corps of Discovery. . . .

Israel Armstrong, bighearted and overly inquisitive, should stick to delivering library books to out-of-the-way readers and not get involved in the investigation. But of course, he can't help himself&#x2014;which costs him his job and earns him a place of dishonor among the police's prime suspects. Can Israel clear his name and get his van back? Will the exhibition of old local photos he's been driving around County Antrim offer clues to Mr. D.'s whereabouts? And is a romance in the offing with winsome barmaid Rosie Hart? </p> <p> All will be revealed! </p></p><p><p>Ian Sansom is the author of 10 books of fiction and non-fiction. He is a former Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and a former Writer-in-Residence at the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry in Belfast. He is currently a Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literary Studies at the University of Warwick. He is a regular broadcaster on BBC Radio 4 and Radio 3 and he writes for <em>The Guardian</em> and <em>The London Review of Books.</em></p>In <i>The Case of the Missing Books</i> (2007), the first installment in the Mobile Library series, Sansom overcame a paper-thin plot with scene after hilarious scene, as Israel Armstrong, the unlikely librarian of Tumdrum, Northern Ireland, tried to both adapt to village life and solve the titular crime. With the second installment, the question is this: now that we're familiar with our fish-on-land protagonist, and he is familiar with the locals, will character carry the day? The plot here is just as slight (Israel is mistakenly arrested in connection with a department-store theft and the disappearance of the store's owner) and the crime solving just as haphazard (Israel's crime-novel posturing, gleaned from paperbacks, ends in pratfalls)--and yes, the whole affair feels a bit lacking. Sansom can still be awfully funny, but even readers who love a put-on may start longing for him to develop some plotting chops. It's one thing to pull a beard; it's something else entirely to grow one yourself. <i>Keir Graff</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

How do motion pictures tease us into building what we all agree to call stories? In this study, David Bordwell offers the first comprehensive account of how movies use fundamental principles of narrative representation, unique features of the film medium, and diverse story-telling patterns to construct their fictional narratives. The result is a pioneering, far-reaching work which will change the way we perceive narrative film&#x2014;and which every serious film scholar, student or fan will welcome.<br><br>&#x201c;This book is of crucial importance to film specialists.

The work, I predict, will be widely read, praised, debated, and damned. Brodwell&#x2019;s originality lies not so much in demonstrating the deficiencies of other theories, which he does very convincingly, but in the scope and design of his project, against which there is no competition of comparable intellectual weight.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jerry Carlson, DePaul University</p></p><p>What is cinematic storytelling?

The author, who is as comfortable talking about Al Jolson movies as he is describing the career of Jean-Luc Godard, has made a major contribution to film studies and the field of narrative theory.In this study, David Bordwell offers the first comprehensive account of how movies use fundamental principles of narrative representation, unique features of the film medium, and diverse story-telling patterns to construct their fictional narratives. The result is a pioneering, far-reaching work which will change the way we perceive narrative film--and which every serious film scholar, student or fan will welcome.</p><h2>Whispers from the Shadows (Volume 2) (Culper Ring Series)</h2><p><p>This exciting and adventurous romantic spy novel is the second book in a new series from Roseanna M. White. <i>Whispers from the Shadows</i> combines fascinating cloak-and-dagger secrets with a tale of love and intrigue during the War of 1812.</p><p>Treachery causes Gwyneth Fairchild&#x2019;s world to crumble. The daughter of a British general, she barely saves her life by fleeing London aboard a ship to America. Her goal is to find refuge with the Lane family in Maryland, having been told by her father she could implicitly trust Winter and Bennet Lane, even though their nations are once again at war. After meeting their son, Thad, she wonders how safe she truly is when she discovers that the Lanes trade in a dangerous commodity&#x2015;espionage.</p><p>Not long after Gwyneth finds refuge in his city, Thad Lane experiences the tug of love, though he fears it may blur lines of loyalty. With family playing the part of enemies and enemies proving themselves friends, a future with Gwyn is uncertain. But at this moment, with the British advancing on Washington and Baltimore, they have only their shared faith in God as a shield about them.</p></p><p><p><b>Roseanna M.

You made the best case you knew how, and your friend still wasn't persuaded to follow Christ. Why is it that solid, rational arguments for the Christian faith often fail? For over fifty years James Sire, noted author and public defender of the Christian faith, has asked himself that question. Sometimes, of course, the arguments themselves just aren't that good. How can we make them better? Sometimes the problem has to do with us and not the arguments. Our arrogance, aggressiveness or cleverness gets in the way, or we misread our audience. Sometimes the problem lies with the hearers. Their worldview or moral blindness keeps them from hearing and understanding the truth. With wisdom borne of both formal and informal experience, Sire grapples with these issues and offers practical insight into making a more persuasive case for Christ. <em>Includes an annotated bibliography of resources for framing effective arguments.</em></p><p>Features &amp; Benefits <p>* Shows why good arguments may fail to persuade</p><p>* Gives advice on understanding your audience</p><p>* Gives advice on strengthening your argument</p><p>* Includes an annotated bibliography of resources</p>Why did you decide Christians needed a book like Why Good Arguments Often Fail? <p>James Sire: The besetting sin of a Christian witness is to believe that if a Christian frames the case for Christ well, those addressed will have no reason to reject its conclusions and will readily accept Christ. In other words, good apologists win every argument they have with non-Christians. This is just not so. And thinking it is leads to frustration, discouragement and, worse, an attack on the moral character of those they have tried unsuccessfully to persuade. One of the subtitles I toyed with was An Antidote for Discouraged Apologists. </p><p>On the positive side, I wanted to help Christians hone their skills at arguing well. The book contains examples of both successes and failures.</p></p><h2>Jizo Bodhisattva: Guardian of Children, Travelers, and Other Voyagers</h2><p>Jizo is an important bodhisattva or "saint" of the Mahayana Buddhist tradition. Most prominent today in Japanese Zen, Jizo is understood to be the protector of those journeying through the physical and spiritual realms. This bodhisattva is closely associated with children, believed to be their guardian before birth, throughout childhood, and after death. <br><br>Here, an American Zen master offers an engaging and informative overview of the history of this important figure and conveys the practices and rituals connected with him, including a simple ceremony for remembering children who have died. Inspired by her own personal experience with Jizo practice, Bays explains how the Buddhist teachings on Jizo can bring peace to those confronted with suffering and loss.</p><p>Jan Chozen Bays, MD, is a Zen master in the White Plum lineage of the late master Taizan Maezumi Roshi.

Although biomechanical embryology can be traced back to the 19th century, up until recently the most commonly accepted framework for the study of human ontogeny (development of the individual) was molecular biology, which all too frequently relied on findings from animal experiments that remained untested for humans. German embryologist and anatomist Erich Blechschmidt&#39;s research concentrates on the evidence presented by the human embryo itself. He offers a new approach to the study of early human growth as a way to shed light on the development of body build, instincts, gestures, language, mathematics, tools, and dress.</p><p>Erich Blechschmidt was an anatomist and embryologist who worked for more than forty years on the problem of human form and the way that form arises in the course of ontogeny, principally during the first eight weeks or so after conception. He has provided us with more than 120 scientific papers and numerous books concerning the development of human form and function. One unique aspect of Blechschmidt's research is that it concentrates on the evidence presented by the human embryo itself, in the form of a comprehensive collection of about 200,000 serial sections of embryos at different ages and sixty-four enlarged total reconstructions at the University of Guttingen (The Blechschmidt Collection and Museum). The sustained investigation of this wealth of material led to a totally new way of looking at early human development, which compels us to re-think older interpretations based mainly on phylogenetic or molecular biological studies. It is possible to see how adult functions arise naturally and consistently from the embryo's earlier growth functions. This present book is a condensation of many of these findings and a presentation of the new viewpoint.<br>&#x2014;Brian Freeman, Ph.D. Anatomy, UNSW, from the <i>Preface</i>"Erich Blechschmidt profoundly reaches through the doorway of the most sacred and the most scientific."<br>-James Jealous, D.O.</p><h2>Earth: An Alien Enterprise: The Shocking Truth Behind the Greatest Cover-Up in Human History</h2><p><p><strong>A shocking new expos� of the twentieth century&#x2019;s extraterrestrial visitations (and cover-ups) by distinguished UFologist Timothy Good</strong></p><p>This fascinating new volume&nbsp;tells the story of contact between aliens and humans from all across the globe, dating back to 1932, including meetings with military personnel and American presidents such as Eisenhower and Kennedy.</p><p>For the first time, a former member of MI6 reveals her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed that there were &#x201c;other&#x201d; spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969.

So was Mother.<br><br>The Woman&#x2019;s Association of Northern California, Conquistadores Chapter Number XVI, was housed in a sumptuous turn-of-the-century, Beaux-Arts-touched-by-Gothic castle topped by crenellations and turrets, and constructed of massive blocks of mauve-gray Deer Isle granite from a long-dead quarry in Maine. The interior was predictable: somber and dark save for stained-glass windows featuring historical Gold Rush scenes that blew jeweled patches on the walls when the sun shone through. Antique Persian rugs softened well-worn walnut floors, the staircase banister gleamed from decades of polish, thirty-foot ceilings were coffered and rimmed with gold. The ground floor of the building held all the public rooms, the two floors above contained sleeping chambers for the members.<br><br>Mother had been a member of the Association for more than fifty years and sometimes slept over in a room far too modest for her. But the fees were nominal, and nostalgia was worth something. Her dinners at the club were frequent. They made her feel special.<br><br>They made Davida feel like a freak but she gritted her teeth and indulged Mother&#x2019;s preferences because the woman was a not-too-healthy eighty.<br><br>Most dinners meant Mother and various selections of dear friends, each one of them more than a step out of time. The entire concept of the Association with its genteel Gatsby pretensions would have been anachronistic anywhere. Nowhere was it more absurd than here in Berkeley.<br><br>A stroll from the club was the People&#x2019;s Park, originally conceived as a monument to free speech but reduced to a square block of homeless encampments and ad hoc soup kitchens. Good intentions in the abstract, but the brown rectangle reeked of unwashed bodies and decaying food and on hot days anyone not blessed by nasal congestion kept a wide berth.<br><br>Not far from the park was the Gourmet Ghetto, the foodie mecca that typified Berkeley&#x2019;s mix of hedonism and idealism. And dominating it all, the UC. It was these contrasts that gave the city a unique character, with everything blanketed by a definite Point of View.<br><br>Davida loved the city with all its strengths and its foibles. Leftist and proud, she was now part of the system, duly elected state representative from District 14. She loved her district and she loved her constituents. She loved the energy and the electricity of a town stoked by people who cared about issues. So different from her hometown, Sacramento, where dishing dirt was respectable recreation.<br><br>And yet, here she was commuting back to the capital.<br><br>All for a good cause.<br><br>Tonight the dome-roofed, hush-hush dining room was dense with tables dressed with starched linen and sparkling silver and crystal, but shy on diners. Members were dying off and very few women elected to follow in their mothers&#x2019; footsteps. Davida had joined the Association a few years back because it was politically smart to do so. She knew most of the members as friends of her mother and they enjoyed the attention she paid them. Their monetary contributions were stingy compared to their assets, but at least they gave&#x2014;more than Davida could say about a lot of her own allegedly altruistic pals.<br><br>Tonight, it was just Davida and Mother. Their server handed them menus and Davida and her mother silently scanned tonight&#x2019;s choices. The entr�es, once biased toward steaks and chops, had conceded to present-day realities with more chicken and fish. The food was excellent, Davida had to grant that. In Berkeley, bad food was almost as serious an iniquity as being a Republican.<br><br>Mother insisted on flirting with the waiter, an elfin-looking man<br><br>in his thirties named Tony who was undoubtedly gay. Mother damn well knew he was gay but she batted her lashes like a moony adolescent.<br><br>Tony played his part by smiling and batting back. His lashes outclassed Mother&#x2019;s&#x2014;thicker and darker than any man&#x2019;s deserved to be.<br><br>Davida knew Mother was worried, trying to mask it with a false cheer. Still dwelling on the incident.<br><br>Though it had seemed like a big deal last week&#x2014;and certainly demeaning &#x2014;Davida now had the perspective to see it for what it had been: a stupid prank executed by stupid people.<br><br>Eggs. Sticky, repellent, but not dangerous.<br><br>Still, Mother brooded as she forked her shrimp cocktail. Davida&#x2019;s minestrone soup remained untouched because dealing with Mother tightened up her esophagus. If the wall of silence didn&#x2019;t come down, both of them would end up with indigestion and Davida would leave the club in need of . . . something.<br><br>Davida loved her mother, but Lucille Grayson was a supreme pain in the ass. Lucille called Mr. Eyelash over, asked for a refill of Chardonnay and drained it quickly. Maybe alcohol would settle her down.<br><br>Tony returned and announced the specials. Mother ordered the blackened Chilean sea bass and Davida opted for the linguini with chicken in vodka and sun-dried tomato sauce. Tony gave a dancer&#x2019;s bow and sailed away.<br><br>&#x201c;You look good,&#x201d; said Davida. Not a lie. Lucille maintained clear blue eyes, a sharp nose, prominent chin and strong teeth. Thick, luxuriant hair for an old woman, once auburn, now a gray one shade darker than the club&#x2019;s granite walls. Davida hoped she&#x2019;d age as well. Decent odds; she bore an uncanny resemblance to Mother and at forty- three, her own auburn waves lacked a single silver strand.<br><br>Mother didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>&#x201c;Your skin looks great,&#x201d; said Davida.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the facials,&#x201d; Mother responded. &#x201c;When&#x2014;and if&#x2014;you go to the spa, ask for Marty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you say. How long has it been, Davida, since you&#x2019;ve taken care of your skin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had other things on my mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I bought you a certificate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was a terrific gift, thank you, Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a stupid gift if you don&#x2019;t use it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mother, it doesn&#x2019;t have an expiration date. Don&#x2019;t worry. It&#x2019;ll get used. If not by me, I&#x2019;m sure Minette will be happy to indulge.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother&#x2019;s jaw set. She forced a smile. &#x201c;No doubt she would be. However, she isn&#x2019;t my daughter.&#x201d; She picked up her wineglass and sipped, trying for nonchalance but a trembling lip betrayed her. &#x201c;You have a little bruise . . . on the apple of your right cheek.&#x201d;<br><br>Davida nodded. &#x201c;The cover-up must have come off. How bad does it look?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, darling, you wouldn&#x2019;t want to face your public like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Davida smiled. &#x201c;They might think that you were beating up on me.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother didn&#x2019;t appreciate the humor. Her eyes misted. &#x201c;Bastards!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I agree.&#x201d; Davida took the old woman&#x2019;s hand, the skin nearly translucent, traced with delicate veins the color of a misty sky. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Please don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any idea yet who did it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stupid kids.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ambiguous and elusive and I&#x2019;m not the press, Davida. Have the police made any arrests?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet. I&#x2019;ll let you know when it happens.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When, not if?&#x201d;<br><br>Davida didn&#x2019;t answer. A Latino busboy murmured something polite and removed appetizer dishes. Moments later, he returned with the entr�es. Davida wondered why, in fine restaurants, the busboys always served the meal. What were the waiters? Food Transport Consultants?<br><br>She thanked him in Spanish and swirled a forkful of pasta. &#x201c;Delicious. How&#x2019;s your food, Mother?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Again blue eyes clouded. Lucille looked close to tears.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it, Mother?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It could have been bullets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Luckily, it wasn&#x2019;t. So let&#x2019;s just enjoy this meal and being together.&#x201d; Which was an oxymoron because whenever they were together conflict was inevitable.<br><br>Mother harrumphed, and then abruptly plastered a smile across her face as she waved across the room to two women who&#x2019;d just entered.<br><br>Darlene MacIntyre and Eunice Meyerhoff. The duo hobbled over to the table, tongues clucking in unison. Darlene was short and pudgy, Eunice tall and severe with impossibly black hair drawn back in a Dragon Lady bun.<br><br>Lucille blew air kisses.<br><br>&#x201c;Darling!&#x201d; Eunice gushed. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fabulous, what else? Enjoying a dinner with my busy daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>Eunice turned her eyes to Davida. &#x201c;Are you all right, honey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Thanks for asking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was just terrible!&#x201d;<br><br>Lucille said, &#x201c;Not to mention frightening.&#x201d;<br><br>Darlene said, &#x201c;Motherfuckers!&#x201d;<br><br>Davida broke into laughter, but was grateful that the room was empty. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t have said it better, Mrs. MacIntyre.&#x201d; She took a sip of her wine. &#x201c;Would you two like to join us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We wouldn&#x2019;t dream of intruding,&#x201d; Eunice said. &#x201c;Your mother rarely sees you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that what she tells you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All the time, dear.&#x201d;<br><br>Davida shot a mock-stern look at Mother then focused her gaze back to the two old women. &#x201c;Well, then, it&#x2019;s lovely to see you both. Enjoy your evening.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You, too,&#x201d; Darlene answered. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t let those assholes get you down.&#x201d;<br><br>When they&#x2019;d toddled off, Davida said, &#x201c;I hardly see you?&#x201d;<br><br>Mother reddened slightly. &#x201c;Eunice is a troublemaker . . . I don&#x2019;t complain about you chronically, Davida. That battleaxe is smitten with jealousy because her Jane detests her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that a bit of an exaggeration?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hardly, Davida. Eunice sided with Jane&#x2019;s ex during the last divorce. Though I suppose one can understand her frustration, seeing as it was a third divorce.&#x201d; Sly smile. &#x201c;Or perhaps sixth. Or twenty-sixth, I&#x2019;ve lost count.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Third,&#x201d; Davida said. &#x201c;I heard about Eunice taking Parker&#x2019;s side. On top of being tacky and disloyal, it was misguided. Parker Seldey&#x2019;s a jerk and a maniac.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But good-looking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Once upon a time. I hear he has quite the temper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So do I, but that doesn&#x2019;t concern Eunice. Because he was courtly to her&#x2014;remembering her birthday, that kind of nonsense.&#x201d; Lucille sighed. &#x201c;One&#x2019;s blood is one&#x2019;s blood. Still, by the same token, despite Eunice&#x2019;s quirks, Jane shouldn&#x2019;t despise her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s angry at Eunice, but she doesn&#x2019;t hate her, Mother. Believe me, I know.&#x201d;<br><br>Jane Meyerhoff had been Davida&#x2019;s friend since grade school and one of her roomies at the UC. Both had been rebellious teenagers, smoking dope, skipping school, hauled in more than once for petty theft in Sacramento. Stupid self-destructive acts committed because neither girl liked herself.<br><br>Jane had carried fifty extra pounds and hated her &#x201c;summer squash&#x201d; nose. She starved and vomited the weight off during her freshman year in college, got the nose job as a junior. But old self-images die hard, and Jane had never been comfortable with who she was.<br><br>Probably never would be comfortable, Davida decided with some sadness.<br><br>She, on the other hand, came to grips with herself well before college. Everything changed a few months before her senior prom when she came out.<br><br>Like birthing a child: painful, but you had something to show for it. Coming out meant life was suddenly honest&#x2014;illuminated by a clean, bright light Davida had never imagined.<br><br>She chewed her pasta while glancing across the table. Mother had many faults, but homophobia wasn&#x2019;t one of them. She&#x2019;d never given a rat&#x2019;s ass that her only surviving child was gay.<br><br>Perhaps it was because Mother, though resolutely heterosexual, didn&#x2019;t care for men in general and hated Davida&#x2019;s father, in specific.<br><br>The Honorable Stanford R. Grayson, District Court Judge (ret.), now lived in Sarasota, Florida, where he played golf with a second wife twenty years younger than Lucille. Mother had been thrilled when the old man got re-hitched, for now she had something else to complain about. And Father had step-grandchildren with Mixie, so he ignored Davida and left her all to Lucille.<br><br>If Mother ever felt pangs about her lack of grandchildren, she never expressed her longings to Davida.<br><br>Mother picked at her food and pushed it around on her plate. &#x201c;How often do you see Janey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bit more since she moved to Berkeley.&#x201d; Davida smiled tightly. &#x201c;I try to keep in contact with all my old college roomies.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother had wanted her daughter to go to Stanford. Davida insisted on Berkeley. Once there, she&#x2019;d never really left, working first as an assistant to the mayor, then moving to the capital, where she gofered for Ned Yellin, the most progressive member of the assembly. Ned&#x2019;s shockingly sudden death from a heart attack had propelled her own career. Now she represented her district with workaholic pride and loved her job.<br><br>Although there were days like yesterday that made her wonder why she&#x2019;d ever shaken the hornet&#x2019;s nest that was state politics. It was challenge enough to deal with the vagaries of constituents basically in harmony with her views. Working with&#x2014;and around&#x2014;her less- enlightened colleagues could be as frustrating as . . . there really wasn&#x2019;t anything worse.<br><br>Less enlightened; her euphemism of the month. Bigoted and biased would be more accurate. Then again, everyone had his own agenda. She certainly had hers and it had nothing to do with sexual orientation.<br><br>When she was ten, her older sister Glynnis had finally succumbed to her protracted battle with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare muscle tumor. Davida had loved her sister and watching Glynnis spend her last days confined to a hospital bed, hooked up to tubes, clammy gown wrapped around a sallow, stick-thin body, bleeding from her gums and nose . . .<br><br>Glynnis&#x2019; blood cells were in steady retreat and there were no new donors to be found.<br><br>Stem cells would have saved Glynnis, Davida was convinced of that. How different would things have been for the Grayson family if the scientific community had been funded righteously?<br><br>Two and a half years ago, Davida had been heartened when the people voted in an initiative funding a state stem-cell institute. But years later, she was disillusioned and angry: all the institute had accomplished was creating a board of directors and issuing a namby- pamby mission statement.<br><br>&#x201c;Science works gradually&#x201d; was the excuse. Davida wasn&#x2019;t buying it. People like Alice had the answer, but Alice hadn&#x2019;t even been consulted by the new board&#x2014;Davida&#x2019;s repeated requests notwithstanding.<br><br>She decided she&#x2019;d waited long enough. Buttressed by a battalion of scientists, doctors, clergy, humanists and genetic sufferers, she went to war every day in Sacramento, laboring to convince her less- enlightened colleagues that a less grandiose but more efficient legislative approach was the answer.<br><br>And got precious little for her efforts.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t that the stodgy pols really cared about aborted fetuses, because she&#x2019;d learned that few pols cared about anything other than getting reelected. Though they screamed a good case. Six months into her struggle, she was convinced it was Davida they were rejecting. Because of who she was.<br><br>Day after day of wearing out her vocal cords, making deals she really didn&#x2019;t want to make, wasting hours on mind-numbing meetings. Now eggs in her face, on her blouse . . . right there on the capitol steps, the humiliation.<br><br>What a mess&#x2014;there was a metaphor for you.<br><br>Mother&#x2019;s voice snapped her back to the here and now. Prattling on about dangers lurking around every corner.<br><br>According to Lucille, Davida was a major target of every white- supremacist hate group in California, not to mention Bible Belt pro- lifers, hypermacho antigay farmers from the San Joaquin Valley, and, of course, misogynists of every stripe and gender.<br><br>She recalled Mother&#x2019;s first words after the election results were tallied and Davida&#x2019;s supporters broke into raised-fist cheers in the social hall of the old Finnish church.<br><br>Be careful, dear. Don&#x2019;t get cocky and think because you can get elected here that you&#x2019;re really popular.<br><br>Mother was being her typi...</p><h2>Silhouette in Scarlet: A Vicky Bliss Novel of Suspense (Vicky Bliss Series, 3)</h2><p><p>One perfect red rose, a one-way ticket to Stockholm, and a cryptic "message" consisting of two Latin words intrigue art historian Vicky Bliss&#x2014;as they were precisely intended to do.

And I'm not just saying that because I work here at Ballantine/Fawcett and I have to. Being in the editorial department, there are always way too many books to read and way too little time to do it in. That's why when I first overheard one of my colleagues raving about this book to someone, I didn't give it a second thought. While it's nice to know at least a little something about the current books on our list (no small feat), this book had never caught my eye as something I'd be interested in. But after the millionth time I'd heard my cohort extolling the virtues of this book to anyone who would listen, I figured I would give it a shot. <br><br>I started reading it on my vacation, and it's a good thing, because I couldn't put it down to do anything else! I'm not quite sure what I can say about it that will do it justice, because it can be viewed so many different ways by different people----it's beautiful, ugly, sad, optimistic, and intensely compelling all at the same time. Suffice it to say that it's one of those once-in-a-lifetime books that just makes you stop and sit-up and think about things that you've never given second thought to before. <br><br>-----J.

At once revolutionary and eminently practical, this is the book that finally solves the puzzle of aging.</p><p><b>Stephen Cherniske,</b> <b>M.S.</b>, a nutritional biochemist, directed the nation&#x2019;s first FDA-licensed clinical laboratory specializing in nutrition testing, advised the U.S. Olympic team, and served on the faculty of the American College of Sports Medicine. He currently serves as president and chief scientific officer for Oasis Wellness Network in Broomfield, Colorado.<b>One<br><br>Foundations<br></b><br>Although this took place more than thirty-five years ago, I remember it as if it were yesterday. My biology professor was about to give me the key to aging, and I was doodling in my notebook, obsessed with the girl in the blue sweater two rows down.<br><br>&#x201c;Nature,&#x201d; he said bombastically, &#x201c;doesn&#x2019;t care a whit about you and me.&#x201d; The statement jarred me from my musings. &#x201c;Nature has one goal, and that is survival of the species.&#x201d; Now he had my attention, because that meant procreation, which I was contemplating, albeit along different lines.<br><br>The argument that he was presenting, which has since been reinforced by decades of research in evolutionary biology, was that aging and death are simply part of the Plan&#x2014;part of nature&#x2019;s game. Survival of a species depends on its reproduction. Through natural selection, traits and behaviors that favor reproduction carry through from generation to generation, while adaptations that don&#x2019;t are selected out. A species that fails to reproduce in adequate numbers to carry on its unique genetic package will become extinct.<br><br>Every species has a certain life span and characteristics that maximize its evolutionary success. For humans, this means a fairly slow rate of growth to maturity, with the highest point of energy, vitality, optimism, and sex drive occurring at around age 20.1 Then we begin to age. It&#x2019;s as if Mother Nature says, &#x201c;OK, I&#x2019;ve flooded every tissue in your body with hormones and maxed out your immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems. Now procreate!&#x201d; And of course, the majority of us do. Then, Mother Nature says, &#x201c;Thanks! I&#x2019;ll give you a few more decades to care for the progeny you&#x2019;ve created, and then I&#x2019;m going to have to get rid of you to make room for a newer, younger model.&#x201d;<br><br>Thus, aging and death. Now, I was hearing this at the age of nineteen, not a time when you think a lot about mortality, but the professor had a remarkable way of driving the lesson home. &#x201c;You,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;are filled with energy, while I have to drag myself out of bed every morning. You have strong, muscular bodies, and I have&#x201d;&#x2014;here he grabbed his belly with both hands&#x2014;&#x201c;fat. You have sex&#x2014;or at least the contemplation of sex&#x2014;and I have fading memories.&#x201d; He was fifty-three.<br><br>Now, I was on a sports scholarship, so the part about strong, muscular bodies was not lost on me. And I was gripped by the sudden realization that this would not always be the case. If this was nature&#x2019;s game, I decided right then and there to find a way to win: to enjoy what I treasured most&#x2014;energy, vitality, and enthusiasm&#x2014;for as long as humanly possible. I was also incapable of imagining life without sex (hey, I was nineteen), and thus began my quest for longevity. I reasoned that success in any game requires that you learn the rules, so I went on to study anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. I attended graduate school and traveled to six continents to unravel the secrets of aging.<br><br>And here I am in my midfifties, past the age of my balding, tired, and overweight biology professor; yet I&#x2019;ve turned out much differently. My body fat is 9 percent, exactly the same as it was in 1966. My blood pressure is 90/60, better than it was back then. My cholesterol is 150, and my immune profile, neurologic scores, and blood tests are about the same as a man in his midthirties.<br><br>How did this happen?<br><br>I learned the rules to nature&#x2019;s game . . . <br><br>And then I figured out how to bend a few.<br><br>&#x201c;That could be just good genes,&#x201d; say the skeptics. But until 1988, I was headed straight for professordom. I was sixteen pounds heavier than I am now, and my body fat was 20 percent and climbing. My cholesterol was 214 and rising; my blood pressure was in the high-normal range. I was tired, and I could read the writing on the wall. Fortunately, an important piece of the aging puzzle was about to be revealed&#x2014;the piece that would enable me to turn back my biological clock.<br><br>Research in endocrinology in the 1980s was showing that metabolism controls aging, life, and death. I was determined to understand this process, not for some abstract academic reason but for a very personal one. A textbook chart illustrating the typical quality-of-life curve for Western man filled me with dismay.<br><br>Notice that quality of life rises through childhood as we learn and grow. Then we hit puberty (yahoo), and from there, we enjoy a brief fifteen to twenty years known as the prime of life. There&#x2019;s a short plateau when things are OK, but then the downward slope starts, and accelerates as we experience degeneration, decrepitude, and finally slam into the brick wall of death at 76.7, give or take a few years. Take a good look at this graph, because if you do nothing to alter your metabolism, this is pretty much the story of your life. Does it look appealing?<br><br>If, however, you understand that something else is happening along with the passage of time, and that that something is actually more important, the graph (and your attitude) can change dramatically. As we&#x2019;ve seen, this something is a metabolic shift from the anabolic, high-energy, rebuild, repair, and restore metabolism of youth to the progressively more catabolic (low-energy, break down, wear down) metabolism of old age. At about age thirty, there is a balance of these two forces, so the idea is to maintain anabolic metabolism at about the thirty-year-old level. My research and clinical experience show that this can be done, producing a quality of life that can look more like the accompanying revised chart.<br><br>In this graph, we can see that quality of life rises through childhood as we learn and grow. Then we hit puberty, and from there, we enjoy a prime that may last forty years or more. Importantly, rebuild and repair metabolism is maintained, so that there is no sharp downward curve in quality of life. You blaze through life expectancy, discovering to your happy surprise that the wall is really a curtain, and somewhere down the road, maybe at age 120, you die. The most exciting part for me is the absence of degeneration and decrepitude.<br><br>If you are willing to attend to your metabolism, you can enjoy this kind of life. The phrase paradigm shift sounds trite, but there is no other way to describe this breakthrough. It will forever alter the way that you relate to your body and mind. It will give you a deep sense of hope where before there smoldered only the resignation of being over the hill. Here&#x2019;s the best news you&#x2019;ve heard all day: there is no hill. Thousands of people have already discovered this, and you can, too.<br><br>Old paradigm: Aging is an inexorable process of degeneration. New paradigm: Aging is a dynamic process over which we have considerable control.<br><br>Old paradigm: The body wears out like our other possessions. New paradigm: The body has astounding powers of regeneration. We produce billions of new cells every day.<br><br>Old paradigm: A life expectancy of 76.7 years. New paradigm: Life potential of 120 years or more.<br><br>FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT<br><br>Research on aging is exploding, and not just because of the number of scientists working in this arena; it&#x2019;s the unbelievable acceleration of knowledge that is taking place as a result of technology. I currently utilize analytical equipment that can give me information in forty-five minutes that only a few years ago would have taken a dozen chemists more than a week to produce.<br><br>Then there&#x2019;s genomics&#x2014;the ability to &#x201c;read&#x201d; information encoded in DNA&#x2014;and of course, the Internet. We do indeed live in exciting times, and I believe we are rapidly approaching the point at which the limiting factor is not science but our ability to cope with the breakthroughs, to manage and integrate the massive amount of information into a coherent and practical plan of action.<br><br>MOTIVATION AND MEANING<br><br>As antiaging research filters down into the public domain, it takes on a certain flavor. This flavor reflects the attitude of those who write articles in the popular press and those who promote various products and programs. At the moment, the sense I get is that the antiaging movement is being fueled mainly by the fear of death. This needs to change if we are to enjoy new paradigm possibilities. Think about this. Someone who is not fulfilled in his life, who has not found the sense of meaning we all desire, will naturally have an acute fear of death. After all, it represents the buzzer at the end of the game&#x2014;a game that, as we approach the end, may seem cruel and unfair. But efforts based on fear will produce limited results. Have you ever watched a basketball game in which one team was playing to win while the other team was playing not to lose? It&#x2019;s hard to have fun when you are motivated by fear.<br><br>Quality of life, in other words, is as important as longevity, and so I approach antiaging not from a fear of death but from a love of life, and this requires that we spend time considering more than facts and hard data. The Metabolic Plan will help you examine what may best be summed up in the questions &#x201c;Why do you want to live longer?&#x201d; and &#x201c;What will you do with the extra years?&#x201d; Above all, I want to inspire you to have a greater appreciation for who you are and what you are capable of. From there, antiaging takes on a completely new flavor, one based not on fear but on celebration.<br><br>We&#x2019;ll start by looking at your relationship to your body. So much of what I read in the popular press implies that the human body is imperfect or limited and that you need some pharmaceutical, genetically engineered, high-tech treatment to enjoy long life. The message is that you are defective and science is going to save you. This is nonsense.<br><br>You are a miracle. Science, no matter how well designed and executed, can never come close to the astounding capabilities of the human body and mind. To those who put their faith in a pharmaceutical fix, I would like to point out that nature has a perfect track record over millions of years. Not a single biochemical&#x2014;including thousands of enzymes, hormones, amino acids, neurotransmitters, and blood and lymphatic cells&#x2014;has an adverse side effect. What&#x2019;s the pharmaceutical track record? How many drugs have been recalled because they were shown to have adverse, even fatal, side effects?<br><br>My focus, then, is using science to support the body&#x2019;s miraculous renewal activity. And this renewal activity can be accomplished deeply and effectively only to the degree that you are aware of what is going on in your body. My motto is, &#x201c;If people knew better, they&#x2019;d do better.&#x201d; I believe it is true on the conscious and subconscious levels. That doesn&#x2019;t mean dry and boring Anatomy 101 but rather a new view that begins with the simple but critically important question, &#x201c;Who . . . are . . . you?&#x201d;</p><h2>American Speeches: Political Oratory from Abraham Lincoln to Bill Clinton (Library of America)</h2><p>Collects the unabridged texts of important speeches, including Patrick Henry&#39;s &#34;liberty or death&#34; speech, women&#39;s rights speeches by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Grover Cleveland&#39;s address dedicating the Statue of Liberty.</p><p>Ted Widmer, editor, is the Beatrice and Julio Mario Santo Domingo Director and Librarian of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University and the author of <i>Martin Van Buren</i> in The American Presidents Series and of <i>Young America: The Flowering of Democracy in New York City</i>.

Visegrad has long been a bone of contention between the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, but the bridge survives unscathed until 1914, when the collision of forces in the Balkans triggers the outbreak of World War I.The bridge spans generations, nationalities and creeds, silent testament to the lives played out on it. Radisav, a workman, tries to hinder its construction and is impaled alive on its highest point; beautiful Fata leaps from its parapet to escape an arranged marriage; Milan, inveterate gamble, risks all in one last game on it.

Such images are given for the purpose of bringing about &#x201c;definite conditions in the social life of the future,&#x201d; related to brotherhood, religious freedom, and conscious spirituality. <br><br>Other spiritual beings, however, work in opposition to the angels. If, because of their disruption, humanity sleeps though the angels&#x2019; spiritual revelation, the consequences will be dire, leading to the manifestation of sexual aberrations, the misuse of medicine, and the misapplication of mechanical and technological forces.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.&#x201c;A great deal is happening all the time in world evolution; and it falls to human beings, particularly those of our own time, to acquire real understanding of the world events in which they are involved.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Rudolf Steiner</b></p><h2>The American Puritans: Their Prose and Poetry</h2><p>Perry Miller&#39;s classic one-volume anthology of Puritan writings recreates the world of seventeenth-century New England through a judicious selection of tracts, journals, sermons, and poetry by the major Puritan writers: William Bradford, Cotton Mather, John Winthrop, Thomas Hooker, Anne Bradstreet, Michael Wigglesworth, and Edward Taylor among them.</p><p>The American Puritan movement is the essential starting point for all considerations of American culture and no book in print provides a better introduction to it than does this one.

With his famous insight, lucidity, and redoubtable grasp of history, Chomsky offers his views on the invasion and occupation of Iraq, the doctrine of "preemptive" strikes against so-called rogue states, and the prospects of the second Bush administration, warning of the growing threat to international peace posed by the U.S. drive for domination. In his inimitable style, Chomsky also dissects the propaganda system that fabricates a mythic past and airbrushes inconvenient facts out of history.</p><p>Barsamian, recipient of the ACLU's Upton Sinclair Award for independent journalism, has conducted more interviews and radio broadcasts with Chomsky than has any other journalist. Enriched by their unique rapport, Imperial Ambitions explores topics Chomsky has never before discussed, among them the 2004 presidential campaign and election, the future of Social Security, and the increasing threat, including devastating weather patterns, of global warming.

So it doesn&#x2019;t matter if, say, 80 percent of the population thinks we should have some kind of national health-care system. It doesn&#x2019;t even matter if the large majority regards this as a moral value. When commentators rave on about "moral values," they&#x2019;re talking about gay marriage, not the fact that decent health care for everyone is part of people&#x2019;s moral values. And the reason those commentators don&#x2019;t care is that it&#x2019;s not their interest. They&#x2019;re like me. They get fine health care. So it&#x2019;s not an issue for them. But for the large majority of the population, it&#x2019;s a serous issue, and it&#x2019;s becoming even more so. When Medicaid is destroyed, as it probably will be, that&#x2019;s going to really harm people. But people are unorganized: they&#x2019;re not in unions, they&#x2019;re not in political associations, there are no political parties in which they participate. They&#x2019;re isolated. The genius of American politics has been to marginalize and isolate the population so it can&#x2019;t act in its collective interest."</p></p><h2>James Agee: Film Writing and Selected Journalism (LOA #160): Agee on Film / uncollected film writing / The Night of the Hunter / journalism and film reviews (Library of America James Agee Edition)</h2><p>James Agee brought to bear all his moral energy, slashing wit, and boundless curiosity in the criticism and journalism that established him as one of the commanding literary voices of America at mid-century. In 1944 W. H. Auden called Agee&#x2019;s film reviews for&nbsp;<i>The Nation</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;the most remarkable regular event in American journalism today.&#x201d; Those columns, along with much of the movie criticism that Agee wrote for&nbsp;<i>Time</i>&nbsp;through most of the 1940s, were collected posthumously in&nbsp;<i>Agee on Film: Reviews and Comments</i>, undoubtedly the most influential writings on film by an American. This Library of America volume supplements the classic pieces from&nbsp;<i>Agee on Film</i>&nbsp;with previously uncollected writings on Ingrid Bergman, the Marx Brothers, Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Lifeboat</i>, Vittorio De Sica&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Shoeshine</i>, and a wealth of other cinematic subjects.<br><br> Whether reviewing a Judy Garland musical or a wartime documentary, assessing the impact of Italian neorealism or railing against the compromises in a Hollywood adaptation of Hemingway, Agee always wrote of movies as a pervasive, profoundly significant part of modern life, a new art whose classics (Chaplin, Dovzhenko, Vigo) he revered and whose betrayal in the interests of commerce or propaganda he often deplored. If his frequent disappointments could be registered in acid tones, his enthusiasms were expressed with passionate eloquence.<br><br> Agee&#x2019;s own work as a screenwriter is represented by his script for Charles Laughton&#x2019;s unique and haunting masterpiece of Southern gothic,&nbsp;<i>The Night of the Hunter</i>, adapted from the novel by Davis Grubb.

She was too busy breaking the wax seal on the letter she'd just received. Her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkled as she unfolded the parchment. Its crinkling echoed loudly in the quiet chamber. She was well past the blush of youth, but it was clear affection had no time limit. Even in her late twenties, Abigail was excited by her love letter.</p> <p>Although, perhaps "liaison letter" might be a more appropriate description. Abigail enjoyed her lovers, and she enjoyed knowing she didn't owe them the obedience a wife would.</p> <p>"Go on, Nareen. I know ye like yer sleep."</p> <p>Abigail drew out the word sleep. She looked up for a brief moment, making it clear she knew what Nareen would be doing under the veil of night.</p> <p>Abigail knew Nareen's weaknesses too. It was the only reason Nareen served her, so she might enjoy freedom as well.</p> <p>"The moon is full," Abigail muttered before looking back at the letter. There was a subtle warning in her tone, indicating she would turn a blind eye only if Nareen returned the favor.</p> <p>Nareen inclined her head before leaving the bedchamber. Once she passed through the arched doorway that separated the bedchamber from the receiving chamber, she allowed her pace to increase.</p> <p>She wasn't interested in sleeping, and luckily, her mistress didn't have any issues with her nighttime rides. Of course, in return, Nareen was expected to ignore the unmarried lady's lovers. So it wasn't luck, it was an agreement. One Nareen enjoyed benefits from as well.</p> <p>She shuddered, a tingle of fear rising from the dark abyss where Nareen had banished several memories she never wanted to think about again. Sometimes it was very hard to forget her cousin Ruth and the horrors Nareen had suffered while with her kinswoman.</p> <p>Yes, the arrangement made it possible for Nareen to escape being under the care of her kin, and the unsavory plans Ruth had been making for her.</p> <p>Nareen turned her attention to the moon. She could see it glowing through the seam in the window shutters. Just a faint sliver of yellow light, it was like a beacon, drawing her toward joyful abandon. The whisper of chilly night air coming through didn't bother her a bit. In fact, it was invigorating.</p> <p>Outside, she didn't have to worry about being trapped within stone walls.</p> <p>Nareen steeled her expression as she went through the doors that led to the stairs. Two Ross retainers stood there, making sure the earl's daughter was well guarded throughout the night. They each held a five-foot-tall wooden staff topped with a wicked and deadly looking spear top. The metal gleamed in the moist Highland air. Their gazes followed Nareen as she left, and they stiffly pulled on the corners of their knitted caps.</p> <p>No one really spared her much attention as she made her way through the partially lit passageways. Several of the torches had been blown out by the vigorous wind.</p> <p>Nareen skipped down the stone steps, making the three stories to the ground floor in a flash. Abigail would be traveling again soon, if the letter held an invitation. That meant Nareen would be on a tighter leash once the highborn lady found a way to wheedle her father into granting her permission to return to court. The earl had sworn he wouldn't allow it, but Nareen knew he'd soften. Once the wine began to flow, the Earl of Ross lost his will. Abigail always exploited her father's weakness to suit her whims.</p> <p>So tonight, Nareen would ride.</p> <p>Many would tell her it was the demons causing the gusts of wind. Nareen scoffed at them. There were legends that went back farther than the Church. Tales of Celtic lore that were still told around the winter fires. She preferred the stories that told of strength and daring, to the Church's teachings that tried to convince her to fear the witching hours.</p> <p>Nareen pulled her arisaid up from where the length of Grant tartan draped down her back, and laid it over her head. During the day, the piece of wool was secured at her waist, and of little use except to make it clear she was proud to be a Grant. But at night, it would shield her from rain and keep her warm. She pulled it around to cover her shoulders before venturing into the yard. Most of the Ross retainers taking their ease in the yard looked her way, but they returned to whatever they were doing once they recognized the Grant colors.</p> <p>She was just the mistress's attendant.</p> <p>That position suited Nareen well. She didn't regret leaving her cousin's keeping, not even when it reduced her to being a personal servant. At least she need not worry about Ruth selling Nareen's maidenhead.</p> <p>Nareen shuddered. The woman held no power over her now. Nareen had seen to that.</p> <p>The horses greeted her when she entered the stable. Her mood improved as she reminded herself that she was free of Ruth and her unsavory plans.</p> <p>Her mare tossed its mane in greeting. Nareen murmured softly to it in Gaelic as she eased the bridle on. Her mare pawed at the ground, eager to stretch her legs.</p> <p>"Me thoughts exactly," Nareen said as she slid onto the back of the animal. The gate watch raised the gate for her, but not without a stern look of disapproval.</p> <p>Nareen didn't bother to look back. She leaned low over the neck of her mare and let the animal have its freedom. The horse picked up speed, chilling Nareen's cheeks as they raced across the open land that surrounded the Ross castle.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Saer MacLeod turned his head, listening to the night. He kicked dirt over the small fire he'd built to cook his dinner, and it died, leaving him in darkness.</p> <p>It wasn't that dark. He'd endured nights that were as black as a demon's eyes, and this one wasn't anywhere near that deep.</p> <p>But there was something-someone-riding toward him. There was no way he was going to greet that stranger anywhere but on the back of his horse.</p> <p>There was a whistle from his man. Baruch held up one finger.</p> <p>Saer didn't reach for the pommel of the sword strapped to his back. A lone rider wasn't that much of a threat.</p> <p>"I thinks it's her..." Baruch rode up close to his laird's side. "Just like the Ross lad told me, she's riding by moonlight..."</p> <p>"Good," Saer muttered. He felt a surge of impending victory and savored it.</p> <p>Nareen Grant had turned him down and dismissed him the last time he'd seen her.</p> <p>He intended to make sure she knew he was not so easily brushed aside.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Nareen was sure her heart was beating as fast as her mare's. The animal slowed, having spent its first burst of speed. Her arisaid had fallen back, baring her head, but she enjoyed the bite of the night air. She laughed, at ease for the first time all day. But her elation evaporated when her mare's ears lifted. Nareen tightened her grip on the reins as she searched the shadows. "Who is there?" she demanded.</p> <p>"Ye take a risk by riding out at night, lass."</p> <p>Her company emerged from the shadows cast by the edge of a woodland patch, where the forest trees thinned and gave way to the slope.</p> <p>"But yer command of the mare is impressive, Nareen Grant."</p> <p>He was a large man. She could describe him as huge, but resisted the urge because there was already a chill tingling on her nape. If he knew her name, it was possible he was an enemy of the Grants. She tightened her knees, making ready to flee.</p> <p>"Ye have naught to fear from me." He nudged his horse farther away from the shadows. Her heart froze as the moonlight illuminated his hard body. There was no mistaking his prime condition, and his voice was deep and young enough to confirm she might be in true peril if he turned hostile.</p> <p>"Name yer clan," she stated boldly. She lifted her chin and stared straight at him. A weak plea would never do.</p> <p>There was a husky chuckle from the stranger. "Are ye sure ye are in a position to demand things of me, lass? Most Highlanders do nae care for a lass who spits fire."</p> <p>"I do nae care for anyone who will nae speak the name of their clan without hesitation. Such actions mean ye have no honor."</p> <p>He rode a full stallion, the horse just as impressive as its master. The animal was prime quality, telling her he had coin in his purse, but that fact didn't reassure her. Many times, noble lords were far more unscrupulous than a common villain. The law favored them in every way, and they took advantage of it.</p> <p>He nudged the beast with his knees until it turned and the moonlight washed over his face. She gasped, recognizing him instantly. And a little too well for her liking. A rush of heat flooded her cheeks, for she had just accused a laird of having no honor.</p> <p>"What are ye doing riding on Ross land in the dark of night, Saer MacLeod?"</p> <p>He moved his horse closer to her mare and leaned down to pat the neck of the sturdy beast he rode. Her attention was drawn to his hand, fixating on the way he stroked the animal. There was a confidence in his motions that sent a tingle across her skin. He was more than bold, he was supremely at ease in the night-so much so, she envied him.</p> <p>More heat teased her face, this time flowing down her body.</p> <p>"This is hardly dark," he said at last.</p> <p>She jerked her gaze up to his face to find him grinning at her. She tossed her long braid over her shoulder, detesting the way he made her feel vulnerable. "Ye're right, it is hardly dark, which is why I am enjoying it. Good-bye, Laird MacLeod."</p> <p>She tightened her grip on the reins and sent her mare in motion again. She wasn't running away; it was simply a matter of doing what she pleased. Aye, indeed it was.</p> <p>Abigail already told her what to do most of the day. Of course, it was far better than answering to a husband or to her cousin Ruth.</p> <p>Her dark memories stirred again, so she leaned low over the neck of the horse and felt the wind pulling the shorter strands of her hair from her braid. The steady beat of the mare's hooves filled her head, but there was something else too, a deeper pounding. She turned her head to find Saer MacLeod keeping pace with her, an amused grin on his lips.</p> <p>She kneed her mare, urging the animal to go faster. It was an impulse that irritated her because she was letting herself be goaded. There would be no responding to Saer MacLeod.</p> <p>She pulled up, the mare settling into a slow walk, tossing her head as Nareen worried her lower lip. "I'm sure ye have important things to do, Laird MacLeod."</p> <p>He guided his stallion in step beside her mare. "Ensuring ye do nae get set upon by the MacKays is important. I hear they have no love for the Ross. They claim the earl killed their laird and have vowed vengeance."</p> <p>"I am a Grant."</p> <p>"But ye serve the earl's daughter," Saer countered. "There would be more than one man who would consider that enough to include ye in their feud."</p> <p>Her heart was beating faster. She drew in a deep, slow breath to calm herself. "I do nae need yer protection." Her tone was far from smooth, further irritating her. She didn't need the man hearing how he unsettled her.</p> <p>He grinned more broadly in the face of her temper, a cocksure, arrogant, full curving of his lips that sent a tingle through her belly. She was amusing him and nothing else.</p> <p>"I do nae need yer permission to ensure ye come to no harm, Nareen. Just as I did nae need yer brother's consent to let me ride along with him to deal with yer cousin Ruth."</p> <p>She jerked, involuntarily pulling on the reins. The mare stopped, snorting with frustration. Saer reached out and stroked the animal's neck again. The horse quieted immediately and made a soft sound of enjoyment.</p> <p>Nareen's mouth went dry at the way his touch pleased.</p> <p>She wondered... "Let me mare be."</p> <p>Nareen tried to pull the horse away. Saer reached out and captured her hand to keep her from commanding the mare.</p> <p>The contact was jarring, his warm flesh shocking her. Her own fingers were chilled from the pace of her ride, but his were warm and inviting. More than a warmth that chased away the night temperature, this was a heat that touched something deep inside her. She licked her lower lip because it was too dry, drawing his gaze to her mouth.</p> <p>She jerked her hand away.</p> <p>"I told ye at court, I want naught to do with ye." At last, she'd grasped enough of her composure to say what she truly needed to.</p> <p>"Aye, ye did." He patted her mare's neck, stroking the velvet surface of her skin with a long motion before answering. "Look at me, Nareen Grant, and tell me if ye see a man who is easily told what to do."</p> <p>His tone was soft and menacing, carrying a warning that even the mare sensed. A chill shot down Nareen's back, her gaze locking with his. She was keenly aware of him, her lips tingling with anticipation. She felt like there was something inside him that was drawing her closer, some force that reached out to stroke her, entice her to do his will.</p> <p>He jerked the reins right out of her slackened grip.</p> <p>"What are ye doing?"</p> <p>Saer didn't answer her. He held the reins, and her mare began following his stallion as he sent the beast forward. Her only option was to drop down the side of the animal while it was in motion. One look at the ground warned her against such a rash action. Moonlight illuminated the rocky ground they rode across, promising her a rough landing.</p> <p>But she was still tempted, because Saer's back promised her something else. His shirtsleeves were rolled up and tied at his shoulder. She was as fascinated by his back as by his keen gaze. A long sword was strapped across his back at an angle so the pommel was behind his left shoulder and easy to reach with his right hand. There was nothing ornate about the weapon, just solid purpose. He was bastard-born and raised among the isles. The Highlanders called him a savage, and his actions proved he was exactly that.</p> <p>He took what he wanted, just as he was taking her.</p> <p>She looked at the ground again, but the sound of water drew her attention to where he was leading her. The noise grew until it was loud enough to drown out the steps of the horses. He guided them around a granite outcropping and down to where the moonlight shimmered off a river. It was swollen from rains farther up in the Highlands, the moonlight lighting the white peaks raised by the current.</p> <p>There was a fire burning near the face of the outcropping they had just come around. It was completely hidden from the open space. Over six dozen horses and men were taking their ease near the fire, the scent of roasting rabbit floating in the air. The orange flicker from the fire showed her the colors of the MacLeod plaid in their kilts. They looked up, but turned their backs once they realized their laird had returned with a female.</p> <p>"Ye would never see trouble coming, lass. The Ross have no idea we are on their land."</p> <p>Saer let out a whistle, which was answered in kind. She didn't care how much truth there was in his words. He slid off his horse and handed the reins to a younger boy who had come up to serve his laird. Saer handed off the reins of her mare to another lad before dis...</p></p><h2>The Ways of Our God: An Approach to Biblical Theology</h2><p>At a time when Old Testament and New Testament studies are considered to be two very different tasks, this major new work by Charles Scobie offers an approach to biblical theology meant to take in the entire sweep of divine revelation.<br><br> Comprehensive in scope, this book covers every aspect of biblical theology. Chapters are devoted first to the nature and task of biblical theology and then to major themes within the biblical message -- God's order, God's servant, God's people, and God's way. Each section of the book also features an extensive system of helpful cross-references. Not only is Scobie's attempt to bridge the biblical testaments admirable, but he also takes great care to present scholarship that is at the same time informed by, and relevant to, the daily life and work of the church. The result is a book that is relevant to readers everywhere.<br><br> Accessible to teachers, clergy, students, and general readers alike, this book will reinvigorate the study of the Bible as the unified word of God.</p><p><b><i>Pro Ecclesia</i></b><br> "Every page brims over with necessary background or new insight. . . If such a resource became a major focus of theological education programs, the quality of preaching in our day would dramatically improve."<br><br><b>I. Howard Marshall</b><br> "Charles Scobie offers a remarkably clear and nontechnical account of the theology of the Bible as a whole in its canonical form. It is comprehensive and orderly, more concerned to set out the teaching and implications of the text than to engage in critical investigations of what lies behind the text, and aiming to provide the church with a basis for the development of its own systematic theology. At a time when the compartmentalization of biblical and theological studies is being increasingly deprecated, it is good to have an author who is so knowledgeable in both the Old Testament and the New Testament and able to produce such an attractive synthesis of their teaching, demonstrating that they do indeed belong together as witnesses to God's ongoing revelation and redeeming work."<br><br><b>Donald A. Hagner</b><br> "In this bold and impressive book Charles Scobie has accomplished what many biblical scholars would regard as virtually impossible. Working with a framework of promise and fulfillment and taking a thematic approach, Scobie has produced a unified biblical theology &#x2014; that is, a truly integrated theology of both Old and New Testaments. Encyclopedic in its coverage, fully conversant with scholarship, sensitive in its treatment of the issues, and evangelical in perspective, Scobie's brilliant synthesis brings the whole of the Bible back to the church. Here is a book that is not only informative but also edifying. A magnificent accomplishment!"<br><br><b>Peter Richardson</b><br> "Breathtaking in its scope and audacious in its execution, Charles Scobie's book tackles with erudition and clarity a task that, for a couple of generations now, scholars have thought impossible. Scobie demonstrates convincingly that biblical theology can be done intelligently and can illuminate the life and practice of the Christian church."<br><br><b>Bibliotheca Sacra</b><br> "A valuable tool for students of the Bible. . . . This work is an excellent resource and will be a valuable addition to any biblical scholar's library. Pastors, teachers, students, and laypeople can benefit from its use."</p><h2>Fiction Writer&#39;s Handbook</h2><p><p>This book offers practical advice on every aspect of writing novels and short stories: plotting and narrative development, characterization and dialogue, sources of material, planning an opening, roughing out chapters, using suspense and emotional color, rewriting and highlighting and much more.

Morrison Series in Southern Studies)</h2><p>This richly illustrated portrait of North Carolina's pottery traditions tells the story of the generations of "turners and burners" whose creations are much admired for their strength and beauty. Perhaps no other state possesses such an active and extensive ceramic heritage, and one that is entirely continuous. This book is an attempt to understand both the past and the present, the now largely vanished world of the folk potter and the continuing achievements of his descendants. It is a tribute that is long overdue.<br><br>From the middle of the eighteenth century through the second quarter of the twentieth century, folk potters in North Carolina produced thousands of pieces of earthenware and stoneware -- sturdy, simple, indispensable forms like jars and jugs, milk crocks and butter churns, pitchers and dishes, ring jugs and flowerpots. Their wares were familiar and everyday, not innovative or unusual, because they were shaped through generations of use for specific functions. The utilitarian forms were so commonplace and embedded in daily life that few individuals documented the craft. <i>Turners and Burners</i> is the first book to chronicle these pottery traditions, with close attention to distinct regional and temporal patterns and the major families involved. It explores in detail the traditional technologies used, from the foot-powered treadle wheel to the wood-fired groundhog kiln.<br><br>Terry Zug became interested in North Carolina pottery in 1969 shortly after moving to Chapel Hill. In 1974 he began documenting the craft and traveled throughout the state recording the reminiscences of potters, former potters, and members of potters' families who recalled the old craft in remarkable detail. He systematically photographed and cataloged old pots, located early shop sites, and carefully recorded the remaining waster dumps of broken shards and decaying equipment. His primary source, however, was the potters themselves. Their tape-recorded interviews provide an insider's view of their world and reveal the powerful underlying logic and autonomy of their craft.<br><br></p><p>"The best book I have ever read on folk pottery."--Warren E. Roberts, <i>Journal of Folklore Research</i> <br>This richly illustrated portrait of North Carolina&#39;s pottery traditions tells the story of the generations of &#39;tuners and burners&#39; whose creation are much admired for their strength and beauty.

His father created the Tommy Taylor fantasy series, boy-wizard novels with popularity on par with Harry Potter. The problem is Dad modeled the fictional epic so closely to Tom's real life that fans are constantly comparing him to his counterpart, turning him into the lamest variety of Z-level celebrity. In the final novel, it's even implied that the fictional Tommy will crossover into the real world, giving delusional fans more excuses to harass Tom. <br><br> When an enormous scandal reveals that Tom might really be a boy-wizard made flesh, Tom comes into contact with a very mysterious, very deadly group that's secretly kept tabs on him all his life. Now, to protect his own life and discover the truth behind his origins, Tom will travel the world, eventually finding himself at locations all featured on a very special map -- one kept by the deadly group that charts places throughout world history where fictions have impacted and tangibly shaped reality, those stories ranging from famous literary works to folktales to pop culture. And in the process of figuring out what it all means, Tom will find himself having to figure out a huge conspiracy mystery that spans the entirety of the history of fiction.</p><p>Tom Taylor is more than just the son of one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors and the namesake of his most beloved creation, the boy wizard Tommy Taylor. He&#x2019;s a living weapon in a literal war of words, in which a shadowy cabal uses the power of storytelling itself to shape the world according to their own dark designs. And he was born and bred to close the book on them forever. But now his own story is headed for it&#x2019;s most dangerous twist yet &#x2013; a real whale of a tale. <br> &nbsp;<br> In order to harness his extraordinary powers, Tom must sail the seas of one of the greatest stories ever told, and hunt the white whale that has left countless stories of myth and madness in its wake. Meanwhile, his friends are hunted by a dangerous new enemy and facing identity crises of their own. Will Tom&#x2019;s voyage lead them all to the answer they seek? Or will he drown in the depths of a thousand and one unhappy endings?<br> &nbsp;<br> In The Unwritten: Leviathan, acclaimed storytellers Mike Carey and Peter Gross delve deeper than eve r before into their frightening, fascinating world!A taut thriller that slyly plays off the real-world mania for imaginary ones like that of Harry Potter, Carey's new series undercuts the mythology of such all-pervasive media-hyped creations while at the same time hinting at a brilliantly imagined one of its own. Tom Taylor is the son of Wilson Taylor and the unwilling namesake of the protagonist in his dad's wildly popular 13-book fantasy series. The Tommy Taylor cottage industry of movies, video games, and geek-ridden conventions is given an extra dash of drama by Wilson's having mysteriously disappeared years before, leaving a cynical Tom (who inherited none of his millions) to eke out a grubby living at paid appearances. Carey's story (solidly illustrated by Gross) picks up speed fast when Tom realizes some elements of Wilson's stories might not be made up. By the time the first story is done, Carey has not only created a brisk and addictive story, sketched with crafty allusions to classic literature, but also neatly subverted the celebrity-worship manias of fantasy fandom and questioned the very nature of storytelling itself. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It famously served as a "laboratory of democracy," a cradle of the labor and environmental movements, and birthplace of the Wisconsin Idea, which championed expertise in the service of the common good. But following a Republican sweep of the state&#x2019;s government in 2010, Wisconsin&#x2019;s political heritage was overturned, and the state went Republican for the first time in three decades in the 2016 presidential election, elevating Donald J. Trump to the presidency.</p><p><em>The Fall of Wisconsin</em> is a deeply reported, searing account of how the state&#x2019;s progressive tradition was undone and turned into a model for national conservatives bent on remaking the country. Dan Kaufman, a Wisconsin native who has been covering the story for several years, traces the history of progressivism that made Wisconsin so widely admired, from the work of celebrated politicians like Robert "Fighting Bob" La Follette and Gaylord Nelson, to local traditions like Milwaukee&#x2019;s &#x201c;sewer socialism,&#x201d; to the conservationist ideas of Aldo Leopold and the state&#x2019;s Native American tribes. Kaufman reveals how the &#x201c;divide-and-conquer&#x201d; strategy of Governor Scott Walker and his allies pitted Wisconsin&#x2019;s citizens against one another so powerful corporations and wealthy donors could effectively take control of state government. As a result, laws protecting voting rights, labor unions, the environment, and public education were rapidly dismantled.</p><p>Neither sentimental nor despairing, Kaufman also chronicles the remarkable efforts of citizens who are fighting to reclaim Wisconsin&#x2019;s progressive legacy against tremendous odds: Chris Taylor, a Democratic assemblywoman exposing the national conservative infrastructure, Mike Wiggins, the head of a Chippewa tribe battling an out-of-state mining company, and Randy Bryce, the ironworker whose long-shot challenge to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has galvanized national resistance to Trump.</p></p><p>Dan Kaufman has written for The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker. Originally from Wisconsin, he now lives in Brooklyn with his wife and son.&#x201c;Through the microcosm of one state Dan Kaufman does a masterful job explaining what&#x2019;s happened to America, and why. It&#x2019;s not a happy tale, but it&#x2019;s an important one.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jane Mayer, best-selling author of&nbsp;<em>Dark Money</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Full of sharply reported details...[<em>The Fall of Wisconsin</em>] laments the state&#x2019;s recent trajectory and chronicles &#x2018;the conservative war&#x2019; on its political legacy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael O'Donnell, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Kaufman argues that what&#x2019;s been happening in Wisconsin has historical significance because it made the state a model for conservative activists...[<em>The Fall of Wisconsin</em>] belongs with well-known recent studies such as J.D.

In doing so, he reveals Wisconsin&#x2019;s transformation from a 'pioneering beacon' of progressive policies, responsible for the nation&#x2019;s first worker&#x2019;s-comp and unemployment-insurance programs, to &#x2018;a laboratory for corporate interests.'&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michelle Hart, <em>O, the Oprah Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What was the matter with Kansas is now the matter with Wisconsin.

The book is a case study of an intelligence failure in the process of happening, with potentially catastophic consequences for the United States. Moreover, Curt accurately diagnoses the larger problems in the intelligence community that can result in intelligence failures. He offers a blueprint for solving these problems, and for winning the war on terrorism, that deserves a wide hearing."<br><br>&#x2014;R. James Woolsey, former director of Central Intelligence</p><p>Could the next September 11 be nuclear? This is no theory, says Congressman Curt Weldon, in his shocking new book Countdown to Terror. It is a fact as real as the arrest of Muslim terrorists who planned to crash a plane into the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire in 2004. What&#x2019;s even more stunning, Congressman Weldon tried to warn American intelligence about the attack&#x2014;but no one in America&#x2019;s intelligence community would listen. How did Congressman Weldon know about it? Because of a secret source, an intelligence contact code-named Ali who has been a treasure trove of reliable intelligence&#x2014;intelligence that, despite Congressman Weldon&#x2019;s strenuous efforts, has been routinely ignored by the CIA and the rest of America&#x2019;s intelligence services. But in Countdown to Terror, Congressman Weldon lets you know what the CIA doesn&#x2019;t want to know. You&#x2019;ll learn, straight from Ali&#x2019;s actual reports: � Why Iran will decide the next terror strike on America � How a major planned terror strike was called off because the terrorists thought it would help President Bush politically � Why Iran, not al Qaeda, is the command post of radical Islamic terror � Who is undercutting American efforts to create a peaceful, stable Iraq � Why Iran is like the Soviet Union in the 1980s: extremely dangerous, the iron glove behind all our enemies&#x2014;yet on the verge of internal collapse � The Iranian nuclear program: red-hot and more advanced than you think Congressman Weldon&#x2019;s sharing of vital intelligence with you, the reading public, is unprecedented. But it is necessary so that the American people can be informed and pressure our government to do what needs to be done to protect our country, fix our still broken intelligence services, and win the war on terrorism. Countdown to Terror is a frightening book&#x2014;but it is all true. And if we act now, we can avoid its grimmest scenarios.Curt Weldon has represented Pennsylvania in Congress for nearly twenty years.</p><h2>Drawing Down the Moon: Magic in the Ancient Greco-Roman World</h2><p><p><b>An unparalleled exploration of magic in the Greco-Roman world</b></p><p>What did magic mean to the people of ancient Greece and Rome? How did Greeks and Romans not only imagine what magic could do, but also use it to try to influence the world around them? In <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>, Radcliffe Edmonds, one of the foremost experts on magic, religion, and the occult in the ancient world, provides the most comprehensive account of the varieties of phenomena labeled as magic in classical antiquity. Exploring why certain practices, images, and ideas were labeled as &#x201c;magic&#x201d; and set apart from &#x201c;normal&#x201d; kinds of practices, Edmonds gives insight into the shifting ideas of religion and the divine in the ancient past and in the later Western tradition.</p><p>Using fresh approaches to the history of religions and the social contexts in which magic was exercised, Edmonds delves into the archaeological record and classical literary traditions to examine images of witches, ghosts, and demons as well as the fantastic powers of metamorphosis, erotic attraction, and reversals of nature, such as the famous trick of drawing down the moon. From prayer and divination to astrology and alchemy, Edmonds journeys through all manner of ancient magical rituals and paraphernalia&#x2015;ancient tablets, spell books, bindings and curses, love charms and healing potions, and amulets and talismans. He considers the ways in which the Greco-Roman discourse of magic was formed amid the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, including Egypt and the Near East.</p><p>An investigation of the mystical and marvelous, <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i> offers an unparalleled record of the origins, nature, and functions of ancient magic.</p></p><p><b>Radcliffe G.

She can be found at cherryh.com.<b>Prologue</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By the charter of the Assassins&#x2019; Guild, there are several re�quirements preceding a legal assassination. First comes the Filing of Intent. In this process, a Document of Intent is entered into the official state registry, stating the issue between the par�ties, so that there is a permanent record, sealed, ribboned, and kept in archive. Any answering document is similarly filed.</p><p>There must then be a public advisement of impending Guild Council action, and an opportunity for the Assassins&#x2019; Guild Council to obtain depositions from both sides. Only after deter�mining that there may exist adequate cause for a Filing, does the Guild Council debate the merits of the Filing, and consider the potential for remedy short of lethal action. This delibera�tion may, at the Council&#x2019;s sole discretion, entail testimony from Guild members employed by either or both sides of the debate as to whether there can be any settlement. And there may be yet another delay imposed while the Guild urges reso�lution short of action.</p><p>If all measures have failed to secure a legal resolution, the Filing is approved by Council vote, and there is a date set after which action is possible.</p><p>The Filing is published, and all parties are notified.</p><p>This affords an opportunity for the targeted party&#x2019;s body�guard to take precautions, and a date and hour after which the complainant&#x2019;s bodyguard may initiate offensive action, entering whatever premises it needs to in order to reach their target.</p><p>In the case of lords or officials employing a permanent body�guard, the bodyguard on either side will be in contact with the central Guild at all steps of the process. No advantage of infor�mation will be given to either side, but in the event an attack�ing or defending unit wishes to suspend action, they may contact the Guild and let the Guild mediate a solution mutu�ally acceptable.</p><p>Generally in small cases, particularly involving property or divorce, approval is given by an office of the Council, without Council debate, but with the deposition of witnesses. Once the Filing is approved by this process, there is a time limit imposed, usually of ninety-nine days, after which all attempts to carry out an assassination must cease and the Filing is set aside.</p><p>In practice, the Guild wishes to avoid bloodshed among its own members, and Guild units may at any time ask a truce in which to advise their lord that their defense has failed and that he must cede whatever is at issue, since he and they will not otherwise survive.</p><p>The number of lords who have pressed a case against the advice of their own bodyguards is relatively small. A unit aban�doning its lord or surrendering him to capture or death may be prosecuted, except if the lord has issued a false statement in the Filing or if the lord is judged to have been mentally or physi�cally incapable of sound judgment. The latter escape clause has frequently been supported by relatives and servants.</p><p>In the case of a private citizen who has no regular bodyguard, a complainant must engage the services of the Assassins&#x2019; Guild from the date of the Filing, and the case is heard by the Office of the Council. The defendant against the Filing must, on noti�fication, either cede the case, if property or a divorce, or hire Assassins for his protection for the usual ninety-nine days&#x2014; an expensive proposition for the ordinary citizen to maintain long term, hence a heavier burden of time for the complainant&#x2014; but there are occasional <i>pro bono </i>Filings.</p><p>Lethal force in civil disputes is common in potential&#x2014; but far less common in actuality. The Filing of Intent affords a cooling-off period, requires depositions and an official vote at some level acknowledging that a wrong exists, and it offers constant opportunities for Guild to secure a negotiated settlement.</p><p>A Filing of Intent is absolutely required before action may be taken against a person or institution, except in defense against an illicit attack. In that case, whatever force the defender can muster on the spot is legal. An attack is defined as a movement within arm&#x2019;s length of the defender, or the first use of a distance weapon or weapon of stealth such as poison.</p><p>It is absolutely forbidden for anyone <i>other </i>than a Guild As�sassin to bring violence against a fellow citizen, except in de�fense of self, employer, household, clan property, or national treasure. A person who violates this law is outlawed, subject to lethal Guild action with no time limit.</p><p>In the event a person finds himself thus outlawed, he is per�mitted to surrender to the aiji&#x2019;s judgment, in consultation with the Guild.</p><p>Edward P. Wilson, Translator, ret., <i>The Assassins&#x2019; Guild</i>, Emer�itus Lecture Series #133, The University of Mospheira . . .</p><p>1</p><p>There were rules of operation for every guild&#x2014; and in the case of the Assassins&#x2019; Guild, the rules were literally a matter of life and death.</p><p>There were rules against collateral damage.</p><p>There were rules about specificity of the target. An assassi�nation had to be announced a certain number of days in ad�vance. And the target was limited to the individual named.</p><p>There were rules about protection of children and uninvolved parties, like neighbors, or guests.</p><p>There were rules forbidding aerial attack, explosive traps, and the use of wires where any other individual, including servants, might accidently run afoul of them.</p><p><i>And </i>there were rules forbidding damage to property. An ac�tion was not supposed to happen, say, where it might damage artworks, national treasures, livestock, or a person&#x2019;s means of livelihood.</p><p>Well, they&#x2019;d done <i>that, </i>a bit, this morning. There was bound to be complaint.</p><p>Bren Cameron closed the computer file. The last time he&#x2019;d read Wilson&#x2019;s paper on the topic, he&#x2019;d been on a plane bound across the straits to serve a new aiji in Shejidan. He&#x2019;d been, in that long-ago meeting with the Secretary of State, handed his credentials, computer-printed. He&#x2019;d been handed the official dictionary, containing all the words approved for him to use in communication with the atevi.</p><p>And with that, State had launched him, the youngest paidhi who&#x2019;d ever held the office, as Wilson-paidhi&#x2019;s replacement.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been excited by the appointment, scared to death of the responsibility&#x2014; and completely unsure whether a novice in Wilson&#x2019;s job was going to survive the year&#x2014; in the real sense of life and death&#x2014; or even whether he might be met at the airport by some party that wasn&#x2019;t official, and he&#x2019;d have no way on earth to know who he was really dealing with.</p><p>He&#x2019;d studied the Ragi language for years. He was good at math, a requirement for the language study program. He&#x2019;d qual�ified as a backup translator for the Department of State, in�tended to become one of those faceless individuals who sat in little cubicles parsing atevi publications for clues to policy and mining them for new words that <i>weren&#x2019;t </i>officially approved, but that ought to be known to other translators.</p><p>He&#x2019;d landed at Shejidan airport on a sunny afternoon. He&#x2019;d been met by two of the aiji&#x2019;s own black-uniformed bodyguard and escorted up into the Bujavid, the fortress on the hill that rose picturesquely above the red tiled roofs and maze-like streets of the capital. He&#x2019;d been assigned living quarters, a mod�est suite in the servants&#x2019; wing.</p><p>Then he&#x2019;d been handed a small ring with three keys, and had had only enough time to toss his bag into the room before his escort had led him on a confusing route to a barren office roughly three meters by three.</p><p>The office supplies, on otherwise vacant shelves, had con�sisted of a packet of copying paper, a packet of fine paper, three well-used pens&#x2014; computers were not part of the technology sur�rendered to atevi at that point&#x2014; and three somewhat worn mes�sage cylinders. On that small desk had stood a bottle of ink, a bundle of reeds, a pen-rest, a shaker of sand, and a waxjack for the seals he&#x2019;d create with the resized seal ring he&#x2019;d worn back to the mainland. It was Wilson&#x2019;s ring, surrendered along with the office.</p><p>He still wore it. And used it.</p><p>He&#x2019;d had no clue on that day even how to use the waxjack. Left to his own devices, he&#x2019;d found the lighter beside the device, lit the wick, and discovered that its whole function was to melt white wax from a winding coil on its baroque stand and drip it&#x2014; he&#x2019;d hastily inserted a piece of paper to prevent a wax spatter on the brass plate below&#x2014; into a small, nicely unstained white puddle on a document. One adjusted the flame to prevent the wax collecting soot.</p><p>That, indeed, was what it did. It was the finest instrument in the little office. In point of fact, it was the <i>only </i>instrument in the little office, except a penknife to sharpen reed pens&#x2014; literally, to shape pens out of the little bundle of reeds, a species that grew to a natural size, of a certain toughness, and that actually made Ragi calligraphy rather easier, once one got the knack.</p><p>He&#x2019;d made his first impression with his ring of office on a letter to Tabini-aiji officially reporting his presence, his satis�faction with the arrangements, and his hopes for a good rela�tionship between atevi and humans. He&#x2019;d put his rolled letter into one of the little message cylinders, the nicest. And there he&#x2019;d sat&#x2014; Bren Cameron, from the human enclave on the island of Mospheira, on the Earth of the atevi, the sole human allowed to set foot on the mainland&#x2014; wondering how he was going to get his letter delivered.</p><p>He had become staff to Tabini-aiji, the young ruler of the Western Association, the aishidi&#x2019;tat, which for complicated his�torical reasons amounted to the rest of the planet. The wax that would bear his seal imprint was white, like the ribbon that would tie his&#x2014; at that time&#x2014; very short queue.</p><p>White was the heraldic color of the paidhi-aiji&#x2014; a neutral party, the translator who conveyed messages between the atevi world and the human population who&#x2019;d dropped, unasked, onto their planet.</p><p>All of Mospheira lived on the tolerance of the atevi. And the last decade or so, after a period of progress, had been a particu�larly anxious time&#x2014; first the unexpected death of Valasi-aiji, then the rule of the aiji-regent, Ilisidi, Valasi&#x2019;s mother. Ilisidi had ceased meeting with Wilson-paidhi, who described negoti�ations with her as like talking to a stone statue.</p><p>Then Valasi&#x2019;s son, Tabini, had come of age, demanding the legislature elect him aiji and set aside the aiji-regent. And among his first acts in that office, Tabini had indicated to Wil�son that he should go back to Mospheira and not come back.</p><p>Wilson&#x2019;s word for Tabini had been&#x2014; <i>dangerous.</i></p><p>Bren had had that warning. He&#x2019;d read Wilson&#x2019;s notes.</p><p>He&#x2019;d come into his office as a babe in the woods, no older in years than Tabini-aiji, and dropped into a very different life, a foreign world to which he was obliged to conform, right down to the clothes he was wearing and the ribbon that had barely enough braid to pin to.</p><p>He&#x2019;d learned a lot over the years. He&#x2019;d changed . . . oh, a great deal.</p><p>He sat here now on a regular train, in company with his own bodyguard, the four closest people in the world to him&#x2014; towering, black-skinned, black-haired, black-uniformed. The only color about them was the deep, burning gold of their eyes.</p><p>And he loved them&#x2014; <i>loved </i>them, although that had been one of the words not only missing from that early dictionary&#x2014; but forever missing from the entire atevi mindset. Atevi didn&#x2019;t love. Everybody on Mospheira knew that. They didn&#x2019;t love and they didn&#x2019;t have friends.</p><p>But atevi had man&#x2019;chi, which in the case of these four, and their Guild, meant everything. They were <i>his</i>. They&#x2019;d walk through fire for him. And he loved them for it.</p><p>They, of course, still thought that love was for salads and man&#x2019;chi was for people you&#x2019;d die for.</p><p>That slightly mismatched feeling wasn&#x2019;t supposed to go both ways, either, but it did.</p><p>They&#x2019;d damned near died for him this morning, and Banichi had one hand supported in a half-zipped jacket because he was too damned stubborn to wear a sling. &#x201c;I can still use it,&#x201d; was Banichi&#x2019;s answer, and Banichi&#x2019;s partner Jago and teammates Tano and Algini simply shrugged off their unit-senior&#x2019;s hard-headedness as drug-induced, and watched out for him.</p><p>More than physical, that wound. Banichi had taken down a former teammate this morning&#x2014; an enemy, an old relationship with a bitter history. Banichi was on painkillers and around the clock without sleep. He was finally getting a little on the train. So were his three teammates.</p><p>Banichi&#x2019;s team hadn&#x2019;t asked Banichi any deep questions on the matter, not that Bren had heard. Not even Jago had asked, and <i>she </i>happened to be Banichi&#x2019;s daughter&#x2014; a fact it had taken Bren years to learn, and that no one within the unit ever ac�knowledged.</p><p>Most in this very ordinary train car were black-uniformed Guild, and most were taking the chance to catch a little sleep: Bren&#x2019;s own four-person bodyguard, Ilisidi&#x2019;s, and the elder body�guard of Lord Tatiseigi of the Atageini&#x2014; all, all had nodded off.</p><p>Ilisidi was sleeping in her own way, fully and formally dressed in many-buttoned black lace, with her cane somewhat before her and her hands on it&#x2014; she at least had her eyes shut, and one was not always sure whether she really was asleep. The dowager admitted nothing about her age, but it was consider�able. Lord Tatiseigi, beside her, attempted to stay awake, but he, of Ilisidi&#x2019;s generation, was giving way, too. The youngsters at the other end of the car&#x2014; Cajeiri and his three young guests&#x2014; human youngsters, all just under or over the age of ten&#x2014; were all collapsed. Cajeiri&#x2019;s young bodyguard was cat-napping by turns, that unit stubbornly staying on duty in the presence of so many exhausted senior units.</p><p>Jase Graham, in the seat across from Bren&#x2019;s, was dead to the world. His two bodyguards, Kaplan and Polano, were up forward in the next car, with their five detainees, who would not be enjoying the trip in the least.</p><p>Jase was one of the four ship-captains&#x2014; and another of Cajei�ri&#x2019;s birthday guests. At least Jase had come down to the world <i>with </i>the human youngsters. But he&#x2019;d actually come down, Bren was increasingly sure, because Lord Geigi, atevi master of half the space station, had gotten a briefing that had very much alarmed him.</p><p>Bren tapped computer keys with a code that had to be input, or certain stored data would vanish, and certain hidden files would, at very great inconvenience, expand and install them�selves instead.</p><p>The file Bren called up now was simply titled: <i>For my suc�cessor: Read this.</i></p><p>There were several sections to the file that came up: codes, notes on various topics, dossiers on numerous people, who to contact first and second. He double-checked that list in consid�eration of recent events, and of who was advantageously located at the moment, with the legislature in session. He kept the in�dex of the collection sparse, and frequently updated. If a succes�sor took over in a moment of crisis, that paidhi would need certain information fast. He had duplicated these essential files in Ragi and in Mosphei&#x2019;, since he had no idea in what language his successor might be more flue...</p></p><h2>Scarves and Shawls for Yarn Lovers: Knitting with Simple Patterns and Amazing Yarns</h2><p>The knitting trend is being fueled by wonderful new yarns like ribbon, frizzy, eyelash, and metallic.

The sun hit his shoulders. Warm as a caress. His suspenders bounced around his legs. They&#x2019;d been abandoned halfway through his trek. Overwhelmed by the reality of what the day would bring, he&#x2019;d dressed in a hurry, hungry for the sanctuary of these woods. Gideon ran a hand over the back of his neck where the stiff muscles complained. A bachelor once more, he&#x2019;d bunked out in his shop the night before, leaving Cassie alone in the house.<br><br>Though he&#x2019;d had both pillow and blanket, sleep had been lost to him.<br><br>With his thoughts ricocheting between Lonnie and Cassie, his past and future seemed muddled. A coil of tangled wire. Rifle slung over his shoulder, Gideon circled his thumb over the smooth wood of the gunstock, the sound of birdsong paving the way to the cabin. Cassie&#x2019;s cabin&#x2014;a place he would no longer call home. But it really never had been. He chewed the inside of his cheek. Where was home now? He knew the answer. There was only one place for him, and that was beside Lonnie.<br><br>His heart lurched.<br><br>Never would he have taken Lonnie&#x2019;s hand had he known he was still wed to Cassie. Never would he have taken Lonnie&#x2019;s hand had Cassie simply spoken up about what she knew. Secrets revealed too late. Much too late. Kneeling, Gideon checked his final trap.<br><br>Saying good-bye to Cassie should be simple. Especially since Lonnie and Jacob were waiting on the other side. So what was he doing out on a cold morning checking traps? Gideon straightened and gripped his catch, wishing with all his heart that it could be more for Cassie. That it could be better. Her words pressed against the edges of his mind.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>I want this chance to do something right. Go home to them.&#x201d;<br><br></i>And here he was, leaving. With a puff of his cheeks and a duck of his head, Gideon walked on. Surely God had been smiling down on him the night Cassie had spoken those words only days ago. She didn&#x2019;t have to let go. But she had. He chalked it up to grace and nothing less. Of her own free will, she was letting him go home. Return to the life he once had. The life with his young bride and son. Gideon&#x2019;s chest tightened at the thought of taking Lonnie and Jacob in his arms.<br><br>He prayed that someday he might extend the grace that Cassie had extended to him. The thought filled him with wonder. Wonder at what it would feel like to have the peace that Cassie felt when she stepped out in faith. In goodness. For in keeping her word, she&#x2019;d given him his future. Which was why he&#x2019;d slept fitfully until dawn, overwhelmed by it all.<br><br>He clutched the rabbits tighter. A warm spell had turned the snow to mush, making his steps easy, but the trail was no match for his attention compared to the truths that roiled in his mind.<br><br>He was leaving today. Though it could take weeks before he got word that all was finalized between Cassie and himself&#x2014;just as it should have been long ago&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t stay with a woman who was no longer his wife.<br><br>Gideon shook his head and strode toward the cabin. Soon he&#x2019;d be on his way to Elsie and Jebediah Bennett&#x2019;s farm, to his family. In a week&#x2019;s time, he would stand before Lonnie. Pulse racing, he nearly lost his grip on the rabbits&#x2019; feet. Gideon tilted his face to the sun, the joy of it all warming him as much now as it had then.<br><br>Rounding the bend, the smell of coffee all but pulled his feet along. He spotted the small cabin nestled against a stand of oaks. Gideon rolled his shoulder that ached in the cool weather and stomped up the steps, spying Cassie in the kitchen window. The house was bright and warm when he stepped in. His pack, filled with all that he owned, sat beside the door. Cassie was at the stove, her braid long and dark down her back.<br><br>She glanced at him, her face registering amusement. &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d be gone.&#x201d; She watched him as he sifted through her crock of knives. &#x201c;You were going to leave at first light.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d planned on it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But...&#x201d; She glanced at the rabbits.<br><br>He found the knife he was looking for, grabbed her worn pan, and flicked his head toward the porch. He lifted the rabbits. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gideon.&#x201d; Her hand on his arm made him freeze. &#x201c;I can do this on my own. All of it.&#x201d; Her expression drove her implications deeper.<br><br>Nodding slowly, he stepped onto the porch. Sitting, he nestled the pan between his feet on the lower step. She moved in beside him and sat. Her patched skirts swayed soundlessly over her small boots. He sensed a weariness in her flushed cheeks. Though the scarlet fever had long since left her body, her strength was slow in returning.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re only gonna have half a day of light.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;ll be off in a bit.&#x201d;<br><br>Hands pressed together, she seemed unsure of what to do with them. &#x201c;How did you sleep?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Liar.&#x201d;<br><br>He glanced over in time to see her faint grin.<br><br>&#x201c;That shack had to be freezing, and you scarcely had enough blankets.&#x201d; She touched the toes of her boots together.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say it was best that way.&#x201d; He peered across the farm to where her brothers&#x2019; hammers could be heard over the quiet of late morning.<br><br>Cassie smirked, but her eyes seemed sad. &#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; She gave him the look that had made him weak in the knees on more than one occasion. &#x201c;After months of sleeping in the rocking chair, you would have suddenly had the notion to take me in your arms?&#x201d; She elbowed him softly. &#x201c;You do realize you never even kissed me proper.&#x201d;<br><br>Feeling a half grin form, Gideon ducked his head.<br><br>Her blue-eyed gaze shifted away, over the farm, as if the fallen petals of their lives were scattered about. &#x201c;Well, the rumors will abound regardless.&#x201d;<br><br>That they would. He and Cassie had been married for months, and people would think what they wanted. It wouldn&#x2019;t help that his reputation around Rocky Knob was anything but saintly. Hands stilling in their work, he studied her, his heart aching afresh. &#x201c;What will you do, Cassie?&#x201d; How he wished he could shoulder this burden for her.<br><br>With a wave of her hand, she tossed his concerns aside. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more to this world than Rocky Knob. I&#x2019;ve got a mind to start fresh. Maybe I&#x2019;ll head to Stuart. Farther, Lord willing.&#x201d;<br><br>That spark glinted in her eyes&#x2014;fire and determination&#x2014;and he knew she was going to be all right. The breeze lifted loose strands of her hair, sending the molasses-hued ribbons dancing.<br><br>Slowly he shook his head, overwhelmed. Through her grace, another burst of joy shot through him. He would see Lonnie again. He would hold his son. Watch him grow up. Memories of them had hung like dusty pictures in his mind, but soon he would add new memories. It was a gift he could never repay Cassie for.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to miss you.&#x201d; Unshed tears glistened in Cassie&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>Throat suddenly tight, he could only nod in return. He rose and, setting the pan aside, dipped his hands in the wash bucket.<br><br>She motioned toward the open door and his pack just inside. &#x201c;Will you be bringing nothing else? What about everything in your shop? all your tools?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Give them to Jack. He&#x2019;ll make good use of them.&#x201d; He scrubbed at the creases in his palms, thankful for the friend he&#x2019;d found in Cassie&#x2019;s youngest brother. He ran the icy water up his forearms, then grabbed the tattered towel.<br><br>Her expression grew so soft, he warred with the urge to cup her cheek as he once had.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be grateful,&#x201d; she finally said.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good kid.&#x201d; He struggled to find more meaningful words, but his gratitude for the young man&#x2019;s kindness ran deep.<br><br>Eyes down, Cassie leaned against the railing. She crossed her ankles, then uncrossed them. Gideon dried his hands on the towel longer than need be.<br><br>She stomped her foot. &#x201c;Off with you now. I can&#x2019;t take this.&#x201d; She waved him toward the steps as if to set him in motion. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like a stray dog that won&#x2019;t leave.&#x201d; She quick-swiped at her damp cheeks.<br><br>He laughed, the sensation filling the empty spaces of his heart.<br><br>She wiped her cheeks again. Gideon captured her hand as it fell. He squeezed it, letting his thumb trace a slow circle on her wrist.<br><br>Without meeting his gaze, she spoke, her voice as soft as he&#x2019;d ever heard it. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t say good-bye. I don&#x2019;t think I could handle it.&#x201d;<br><br>Gideon swallowed the lump in his throat. &#x201c;Fine, then...&#x201d; Cupping the back of her head, he pressed a kiss to her forehead. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wonderful,&#x201d; he whispered against her hair.<br><br>Cassie choked out a laugh. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re a scoundrel.&#x201d;</p><h2>Lovely in Her Bones (Elizabeth MacPherson)</h2><p><b>"Who but Sharyn McCrumb can make a skull with a bullet hole funny?

Of course, writing while at sea is inconceivable. Egad, I abhor being at sea! Luckily the remedies for seasickness liberally doused down my gullet by the ever faithful Dr. Raul Penaflor staved off the worst of the hideous symptoms. I even managed to walk about a bit on deck. Bracing sea air, my derriere! Nonetheless, I was abed for the bulk of the trip, wallowing too far in my personal hellish misery to complain about the narrow confines of our cabin and odiferous mattress. East India trading ships cater to the needs of cargo far above passengers. We disembarked at Ramsgate. I was quite happy to embrace the rigors of overland travel rather than proceeding up the Thames, but several days of subsequent immobility were required to restore my equilibrium ere we moved beyond that lovely seacoast town. Raul, bless his Spanish heart, rather delighted in my incapacitation as it allotted him the opportunity to ramble through the streets and relish the sights. Poor man has never seen England. How does one live? I ask arrogantly.</p> <p>Eventually we set off. I did manage to post a letter warning William of my arrival. I hoped it would arrive well enough in advance, although that did not prove to be true. Apparently the mail service of my great country has not improved. Not all can be perfect. Oh well, that is the way of family! I flattered myself that his astounding joy would be profound enough to overwhelm any irritation at my besieging of the newlyweds. This did prove to be true as well as fortuitous, as William had hurt himself, again, and I am sure it was only my timely arrival that saved him from a life of handicap! Ha! However, I am getting ahead of myself, as you know, dear Jharna, I am wont to do.</p> <p>This trip home has been so anticipated, sea travel notwithstanding. Naturally I was thrilled that Raul wished to accompany me, but even without his companionship I would have had to come. How many hours did I bore you with memories of my homeland, Jharna? Always wishing and praying that you would agree to travel with me. Perhaps I should have prayed to your gods rather than my own. Ah well, here I now am, and never has the green English countryside and crowded London streets filled me with such joy. It is almost impossible to recollect how anxious I was to leave all those decades ago. Perhaps I am getting old, as you would tease. Darcy House stood shining in the afternoon sun, undiminished in her grandeur and loveliness. Moderate chaos reigned, much to my delight, when I crossed the threshold. It was a scene evocative of my youth when all us rowdy children would be tearing about the foyer: Alex sliding down the banister to Mother's dismay, Estella hiding in order to frighten delicate Mary, and James doubled over in mirth while I performed some feat of acrobatic skill. Yes, I must be aging if the frequent jaunts down the ancient paths of my memories are any indication. If the obvious affection between William and his bride are evidentiary of their marital relations, then Darcy House will yet again display such a scene. In fact, they are already on the way as Mrs. Darcy is with child. How can I describe Elizabeth Darcy? Clinically, emotionally, or both?</p> <p>Physically she is a tiny slip of a girl, although actually of moderate height. Strangely, considering the stature of William, she on the one hand is dwarfed by his bulk while simultaneously looming larger than life. Sheer force of personality and presence overcomes her physicality. With chestnut hair, enormous brown eyes, dainty features, and delicate bone structure, she is a picturesque counterpart for my nephew. They complement each other well on numerous levels. However, it is the aforementioned presence that I know has captured William, as I imagine it does all who know her. She is witty, intelligent, sparkling, kind, courageous, and loving. I can readily find no faults, and you know, Jharna, what a penchant I have for divining deficiencies!</p> <p>I will confess that I assumed William, like the vast majority of men in his class, had acquired a wife from the leeches of proper British society. Someone poised, of excellent family, and acceptable, but likely dull, vapid, and shallow. My years away from my favored nephew, his character largely gleaned through James's letters and later his own, fostered the theory that he would take the safe and acceptable road. I cannot claim to have an overly intimate relationship with him, but could have stated with absolute certainty that taking such a path would have rendered him miserable within a year. James always told me that his son's intelligence and restrained intensity mildly intimidated him, William possessing a nature far too zealous and exacting to comfortably fit within the confines of stifling English society. Yet, he would lament, William seemed determined to do so even to the point of suppressing his inclinations.</p> <p>As I recall musing in previous journal entries while visiting home, my impressions concurred with James's. William as an adult and Master of Pemberley appeared to be fulfilling the best of James's predictions and the worst of his fears. That he was brilliant as the estate manager and guardian to Georgie was evident, but there was a sadness and stoic quality to him that even I could not crack significantly. A mere smile or laugh was a rare event, and I think he was frankly relieved when I returned to India.</p> <p>Estella's letter after the wedding filled me with some hope, her impression of the new Mrs. Darcy and William's emotions all favorable. She also related that Elizabeth was neither of society nor even the best family. Lady Catherine flatly refused to acknowledge the union, <em>shockingly</em>, I write with towering sarcasm! Anyway, I am repeating myself. I guess it is just the surprise of the development that still staggers me. James, of course, had married for love, but I know how rare that is. Would even my dear brother have done so if Lady Anne Fitzwilliam were not of the highest caliber and breeding? I do not know. Regardless, William has found his match in every way in Elizabeth. Theirs appears to be the deepest of loves. I cannot be happier for them.</p> <p>Ah, Jharna, how amazing it is to be in the bosom of my family! For too many years I have been adrift with only you to really turn to. Now you are gone and I have longed for the reestablishment of roots. Who would have thought it? And I know you are laughing from wherever you now reside! Be that as it may, I must attempt to smother my sentimental tendencies and write of my days here clinically, or I will fill the remaining pages with nonsense.</p> <p>My dearest Georgiana has evolved into a woman in my absence. She is more beautiful and graceful then I would have imagined her awkward and skinny little-girl shape to grow into. So like Anne in every way. William's personality was always more of a melding of James and Anne, his humor and playfulness there, but reserved. More like my sister Mary or brother Phillip. Actually, as I think on it, he receives that trait from my mother! Interesting. Or, with further staring into space recollections, very like the old Lord Matlock, Anne's father. There was an intimidating man! I doubt he ever cracked a smile, as the world is yet in one piece.</p></p><h2>Last Evenings on Earth</h2><p><p><strong>The first short-story collection in English by the acclaimed Chilean author Roberto Bolano. Winner of a 2005 PEN Translation Fund Award.</strong></p> "The melancholy folklore of exile," as Roberto Bolano once put it, pervades these fourteen haunting stories. Bolano's narrators are usually writers grappling with private (and generally unlucky) quests, who typically speak in the first person, as if giving a deposition, like witnesses to a crime. These protagonists tend to take detours and to narrate unresolved efforts. They are characters living in the margins, often coming to pieces, and sometimes, as in a nightmare, in constant flight from something horrid.<br><br> In the short story "Silva the Eye," Bolano writes in the opening sentence: "It's strange how things happen, Mauricio Silva, known as The Eye, always tried to escape violence, even at the risk of being considered a coward, but the violence, the real violence, can't be escaped, at least not by us, born in Latin America in the 1950s, those of us who were around 20 years old when Salvador Allende died."<br><br> Set in the Chilean exile diaspora of Latin America and Europe, and peopled by Bolano's beloved "failed generation," the stories of <em>Last Evenings on Earth</em> have appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Grand Street</em>.</p><p><p>Author of <em>2666</em> and many other acclaimed works, <strong>Roberto Bolano</strong> (1953-2003) was born in Santiago, Chile, and later lived in Mexico, Paris, and Spain.

And yet, even from the early days of taming the wilderness with clearing and drainage, the Everglades has been considered fragile, unique, and in need of restorative interventions. Drawing on a decade of fieldwork with hunters in the Everglades, Laura A. Ogden explores the lives and labors of people, animals, and plants in this most delicate and tenacious ecosystem.<br>Today, the many visions of the Everglades&#x2014;protectionist, ecological, commercial, historical&#x2014;have become a tangled web of contradictory practices and politics for conservation and for development. Yet within this entanglement, the place of people remains highly ambivalent. It is the role of people in the Everglades that interests Ogden, as she seeks to reclaim the landscape&#x2019;s long history as a place of human activity and, in doing so, discover what it means to be human through changing relations with other animals and plant life. <br>Ogden tells this story through the lives of poor rural whites, gladesmen, epitomized in tales of the Everglades&#x2019; most famous outlaws, the Ashley Gang. With such legends and lore on one side, and outsized efforts at drainage and development on the other, <i>Swamplife</i> strikes a rare balance, offering a unique insight into the hidden life of the Everglades&#x2014;and into how an appreciation of oppositional culture and social class operates in our understanding of wilderness in the United States.</p><p>Laura A.

This is a world where bicycles listen to conversations, inventors search for methods of &#39;diluting&#39; water, and characters play truant while novelists sleep; a world where spiteful fairies wreak havoc and heroes from legend blunder into suburban sitting-rooms. This is recognizably the Ireland of Joyce and Beckett - rowdy, high-spirited, by turns sensual and cerebral -transformed by O&#39;Brien&#39;s unique vision.</p><p>Brian O&#39;Nolan (Irish: Brian O Nuallain) (October 5, 1911 - April 1, 1966) was a twentieth century Irish novelist and satirist, best known for his novels An Beal Bocht, At Swim-Two-Birds and The Third Policeman written under the nom de plume Flann O&#39;Brien. He also wrote many satirical columns in the Irish Times under the name Myles na gCopaleen. INTRODUCER BIOGRAPHY: Novelist and journalist Keith Donohue is the author of The Stolen Child and The Irish Anatomist: A Study of Flann O&#39;Brien.I N T R O D U C T I O N<br>--<br>'I considered it desirable that he should know nothing about me but it was even better if he knew several things which were quite wrong.' So says the eccentric unnamed narrator of The Third Policeman, lost in a strange land, deliberately shielding his identity and true nature. The desire for self-effacement persists among all of the crazy narrators in Flann O'Brien's five novels, and perhaps it is key to understanding the man behind the novel, who has hidden himself as well under a penname. For the very first thing to know about Flann O'Brien is that he is one of the creations of Brian O'Nolan.<br><br>And there are more than one of him. Beginning in his college days and continuing on to the end of his life, O'Nolan was a serial pseudonymist, but we need only concern ourselves with two. In addition to Flann, the quondam author of the breathtaking At Swim-Two-Birds, The Third Policeman, The Hard Life, and The Dalkey Archive, there is Myles na gCopaleen, author of An Be�al Bocht (translated as The Poor Mouth), who appeared nearly every day as the first-person narrator of the column 'Cruiskeen Lawn' (The Overflowing Little Jug) in the Irish Times from through. More often than not, Myles was also a character in 'Cruiskeen Lawn,' serving not only as a narrator and jesting anatomist of the social and political life of Dublin, but also as an elusive figure. A man of so many identities that he had none. Variously self-described as the Uncrowned King of Ireland, the archetypical Dublin Man, ageless confidant of everyone from Synge to Joyce, Myles was a cross between the comic stage Irishman embodying every known stereotype and a savage critic of cliche�d language and thinking, bureaucracy, mendacity, and other social foibles. To the intelligentsia of Dublin, however, and habitue�s of the pubs, Myles was a real human being. He's that man in the corner nursing a pint, the fellow under the hat, the person otherwise known as Brian O'Nolan. On occasion, all three persons met in 'Cruiskeen Lawn,' such as this encounter in stimulated by the republication of At Swim-Two-Birds. In his thick mock Dublin accent, Myles says:<br><br>There's stories going round that Flann O'Brien and my good self are wan and the same pairson. I know my own know about that leaper. People has said that I have receded under many disguises in many papers, but nobody on or under this world knows what I have written or can declare on oath what I have not written. <br><br>Receding under many disguises, Flann and Myles and Brian are wan and the same, although all three have their respective roles. However, perhaps Myles is right to say that nobody can know for certain where one identity begins and ends.<br><br>This much is known: Brian O'Nolan was born on October, one of a family of twelve children, in Strabane, Ulster, Ireland. His cradle songs were sung in Irish. His father, Michael Nolan, was an Irish nationalist who met his mother, Agnes Gormley, in an Irish language class. After they married, the Nolans became theO� Nualla�in (the Irish Gaelic form) and in their home Irish was spoken, with English reserved as the language of social intercourse for the outside world. The family led a peripatetic lifestyle before finally settling in Dublin proper in, where Brian was to spend the rest of his life. Brian O'Nolan's bilingualism played an important role in his intellectual and artistic career, and this split - Irish at home, English everywhere else - factors into the practice of masking his identity. The underlying linguistic differences between the two languages and the historic intertextual relationship with English play an integral role in the style and structure of the work done as Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen.<br><br>But before he was either of those two fellows, Brian O'Nolan entered an English-speaking school at age eleven, and seven years later, in 1929, began his studies at University College, Dublin. There he was to begin his literary career, primarily under the pen-name Brother Barnabas, in the college literary magazine Comhthrom Fe�inne. The fiction of a pen-name allowed Brian not only his highly cherished privacy but also the ability to critique his own humor, by commenting from the refuge of other pen-names on articles and essays he had written as Barnabas. After graduation, O'Nolan continued his shenanigans, aided and abetted by college friends, in the aptly named Blather, a comic magazine, all the while pursuing a master's degree by editing and translating a quite serious anthology on Irish nature poetry. In 1935, he took up a post with the Irish government, where he would remain for nearly eighteen years. Two years later, his father died, and for the next decade, Brian would be the primary provider for the younger children in the O'Nolan family.<br><br>Perhaps the suddenness of this domestic burden caused him to focus on the novel he had been tinkering with since his college days. By 1938, he had completed a draft of At Swim-Two-Birds, and on the strength of novelist Graham Greene's enthusiasm, it was accepted by Longmans, Green &amp; Co. for publication the following year. With this triumph in hand, O'Nolan turned his attention to other literary matters, beginning in October with a letter to the editor of the Irish Times, signed by Flann O'Brien. Joining the contretemps between Sean O� Faola�in and Frank O'Connor, O'Brien pointed to the absurdity of the literary feud, and his letter drew fire from both writers. His friend Niall Sheridan described the flood opened by this first chink in the dam:<br><br>Writing under several different names, he proceeded to carry on furious arguments on many topics, satirizing en passant almost every established literary figure. Before long, many notable personalities joined the m�l�e and the whole affair exploded into a giant display of fireworks, a mixture of satire, polemics, criticism, savage invective, and sheer nonsense.<br><br>This extraordinary letter-writing campaign, with its wildly named participants, was carried out over two full years until the Irish Times offered its instigator a column of his own. 'Cruiskeen Lawn' debuted in October 1940, first alternately in Irish and English, but eventually given over entirely to its largely English-speaking audience. The invention of the pen-name Myles na gCopaleen is a nod to a prototypical 'stage Irishman' from a nineteenth-century melodrama, and hiding behind another identity enabled Brian O'Nolan to protect his status in the civil service. Myles would reign as the newspaper's licensed jester and resident wit for the next quarter decade, and many Dubliners began their day by turning first to 'Cruiskeen Lawn' to savor it with the morning tea or the hair of the dog.<br><br><b>At Swim-Two-Birds</b><br>One of the funniest Irish novels of the twentieth century, At Swim-Two-Birds is an exuberant send-up of literature, the novel, and the writer. Holed up in his uncle's Dublin home for the academic year, an unnamed narrator intermittently works on a mock-heroic novel about a man named Dermot Trellis who is, in turn, writing a novel, in which he freely borrows and steals his characters from Irish mythology and folklore, cowboy novels, and whole cloth invention based on the plain people of Ireland, who become strangely more alive while Trellis is asleep. These characters, frustrated by Trellis's authority, set off on a quest to find his son - the product of his union with one of his own characters - whom they commission to write a novel designed to capture, torture, and try Trellis and thus win their freedom.<br><br>At Swim-Two-Birds becomes a twisted Celtic knot, a book that eats its own tail, achieving its humor through parody and play. The figures from Irish mythology and folklore are exaggerated versions of the original and are re-enchanted through O'Brien's preposterous versions. Finn MacCool, the magical giant of pre-Christian Ireland, 'a better man than God,' an Ulsterman, Connachtman, Greek, Cuchulainn, Patrick, his own father and his own son, 'every hero from the crack of time,' becomes the slightly dim-witted storyteller who calls into being another figure from medieval Ireland, Mad Sweeny, who has been cursed to live as a madman in the trees. Seamus Heaney notes that O'Brien gave Sweeny 'a second life, as hilarious as it was melancholy,' and this mixture of whimsy and sorrow told through the madman's poetry works in counterpoint to the third great figure from folklore, the Pooka Mac- Phellimey, a kind of 'devil, third-class,' who spends a fair portion of the book arguing philosophy and kangaroos with the Good Fairy, a 'voice unsupported by a body.' All of these are set off by the ordinary Dubliners - Furriskey, Lamont, and Shanahan - whose splendid conversations accurately capture the banter among friends who circle around the smallest banalities. And laced over all is the narrator's tale, his early introduction to the pleasures of alcohol, his slide to dissolution, and his uncle's regular refrain about the boy's study habits:<br><br>'Tell me this, do you ever open a book at all?' Stories interlock, break free, re-form. At Swim-Two-Birds is a dizzying, slapstick extravaganza that satirizes contemporary Ireland and the overromanticized view of the artist and the novel. As for the last of these, the student narrator overseeing this crazy quilt has the final word. 'A satisfactory novel,' he writes, 'should be a self-evident sham to which the reader could regulate at will the degree of his credulity.' Furthermore, writers should feel free to draw their characters from all of literature. A wealth of references to existing works would acquaint the reader instantaneously with the nature of each character, would obviate tiresome explanations and would effectively preclude mountebanks, upstarts, thimbleriggers and persons of inferior education from an understanding of contemporary literature. O'Brien writes for an audience in on the joke, and he realizes that humor works through displacement and disruption of the conscious surface, like the explosion of a splash sending ripples across the water, which liberates the tension. For all its allusions to topics from Irish nature poetry to speculations on time, the novel is intended as an extended joke and a celebration of the elasticity of stories and the artifice of art. O'Brien's disdain for certain, clear meaning and interpretation took an even more insidious turn in The Third Policeman.<br><br><b>The Third Policeman</b><br>After the structural counterpoint and weaving together of the four major plot strands of At Swim-Two-Birds, O'Brien experimented with another form for his second novel, and the result, The Third Policeman, might best be described as a hallucinatory existential murder mystery, with footnotes.3 As in his first novel, O'Brien's hero is never given a name, and in the course of his journey, comes to realize that he has completely forgotten it in any case. Along the way, he encounters the seeming ghost of the man he has murdered and finds himself in a land of wonders with a police station at its center, run by the irrepressible Sergeant Pluck, who is overly concerned with bicycles, and the equally strange Policeman MacCruiskeen, who spends his time on marvelous inventions, including a mangle that converts light into sound - all in all, a kind of hellish literalization of the wild surmises of our hero's scholarly pursuits. The whole enterprise, as Brian O'Nolan would say, is played for laughs, and the critic Denis Donoghue points out that the narrator's rather affectless reaction to this world is part of a tradition of Irish anatomies of the human comedy, revealing the author's tendency to 'stand aside from the common urgencies of feeling and to treat the whole farrago of sensibility as warranting merely speculative attention.' 4 If that's the dark way to humor and abstraction, a very deep spiritual dread lurks long after the book's surprising conclusion. As Sergeant Pluck has said, 'The particular death you die is not even a death (which is an inferior phenomenon at the best) only an insanitary abstraction in the backyard . . .' As funny as this way of speaking - and this view of life and death - may be, that abstraction in the backyard gives pause.<br><br>What must have given Brian O'Nolan pause was the fact that The Third Policeman was rejected by Longmans and his agents could not find another publisher. To save face, O'Nolan concocted a number of stories about the supposed disappearance of the manuscript, but in truth, by late 1940, he put the book away and no longer sought to publish it in his lifetime. Flann O'Brien fell silent, giving way to the jests and barbs of Myles na gCopaleen. Only in 1967, after O'Nolan's death, was The Third Policeman brought to print and to critical acclaim. One can sadly speculate on the effect such a rejection had on his career as a novelist and the number of novels never written in this innovative, experimental, and extravagant style. 'Cruiskeen Lawn' provided some solace, and Myles produced a number of comic plays, was quoted daily by an admiring public, and was touted in publications such as the New York Herald Tribune and Time magazine as a comic genius. By 1943, the column had grown so popular that the Irish Times brought out an anthology of his best pieces with a facsimile cover of the newspaper's front page announcing in a banner headline: MYLES NA gCOPALEEN CROWNED KING of IRELAND. The anthology of 'Cruiskeen Lawn' was disposed throughout in two parallel columns in English and Irish, and it marked Myles's last attempt to juxtapose and counterpoint the Irish language of his youth with the English that helped expand his audience and refine his sense as a satirist of Dublin life and culture.<br><br><b>The Poor Mouth</b><br>While it was his farewell to his father tongue, his triumph in Irish was An Be�al Bocht, translated into English in 1973 as The Poor Mouth. While every translation suffers from the journey between languages, The Poor Mouth has the added burden of being a parody of the style and substance of Irish Gaelic texts of the Irish literary revival - primarily TomasO� Criomhthain's An tOilea�nach (The Islandman). Strictly speaking, however, O'Nolan's satire is aimed more at those who wanted to romanticize and sentimentalize the Gaelic people and culture, remnants of a dying language and a dying way of life. Despite its wild exaggerations and forays into Irish Gaelic folklore and archetypes, The Poor Mouth is O'Nolan's most naturalistic and empathetic work. The tension between English and Irish, the allure of civilization and the comfort of the primitive, has its final turn in this novel, and the burden of the truly tragic fades, never to reappear in his work. Writing in the New York Times Book Review of the 1973 translation, Brian O'Doherty says An Be�al Bocht was written in a moribund language about a moribund language for a vanishing audience. Yet for almost any Irishman, the language calls up a primary culture, a lucid and devious state of mind to which only the language gives access . . . [yet] O'Brien's very modern ironies give us as much access to that world as anyone who doesn't have Gaelic can get.<br><br>That lucid and devious state of mind for Flann/Myles/Brian began to diminish as well, darkening with the pressure of the column and the job, the drink and disappointment, the depressed state of post-war Dublin and...</p><h2>Sconed to Death (A Cat Latimer Mystery)</h2><p><b>Cat Latimer pursues a scone-cold killer who iced a top chef in a local bakery . . . <br></b><br> Cat has a full plate at her Aspen Hills Warm Springs Resort, as a group of aspiring cozy mystery authors arrives for a writers retreat.

By 1776, the non-Native American population had increased tenfold, and non-English Europeans and Africans dominated new immigration. Of all the European immigrant groups, the Germans may have been the largest.</p><p>Aaron Spencer Fogleman has written the first comprehensive history of this eighteenth-century German settlement of North America. Utilizing a vast body of published and archival sources, many of them never before made accessible outside of Germany, Fogleman emphasizes the importance of German immigration to colonial America, the European context of the Germans' emigration, and the importance of networks to their success in America</p></p><p>Hopeful Journeys traces the German migrant groups from their origins to their places of final settlement in the colonies. The immigrants&#39; Old World customs, beliefs, and connections did not entirely disappear as they adapted to life in the colonies; instead, the Germans&#39; past ways helped shape behavior in the New World. Germans settled in rural, ethnic communities where family, village, and religion helped them succeed in the multi-ethnic, capitalist economy of British North America. This collective strategy carried into the political arena, as the immigrants and their descendants sought to solidify and protect their gains. Fogleman contends that, to a significant degree, the immigrants and their children developed a new ethnic identity: adapting to the strains of migration, settlement, and politicization, they became Americanized without becoming less German.Aaron Spencer Fogleman is Professor of History at Northern Illinois University.

It continued for days. &nbsp;Some people drowned in their attics, others on the roads when the tried to flee.&nbsp;It was the nation's most widespread flood ever -- more than 700 people died, hundreds of thousands of homes and buildings were destroyed, and millions were left homeless. The destruction extended far beyond the Ohio valley to Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, New York, New Jersey, and Vermont. Fourteen states in all, and every major and minor river east of the Mississippi.&nbsp;</p><p>In the aftermath, flaws in America's natural disaster response system were exposed, echoing today's outrage over Katrina.&nbsp;&nbsp;People demanded change. Laws were passed, and dams were built.&nbsp;&nbsp;Teams of experts vowed to develop flood control techniques for the region and stop flooding for good.&nbsp;So far those efforts have succeeded. It is estimated that in the Miami Valley alone, nearly 2,000 floods have been prevented, and the same&nbsp;methods have been used as a model for flood control nationwide and around the world.</p> 16 Pages of B&amp;W Photographs</p><p>Geoff Williams&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;C.C. Pyle's Amazing Foot Race: The True Story of the 1928 Coast-to-Coast Run Across America.&nbsp;For most of his life, Williams has lived less than an hour away from the Great Flood's epicenter in Dayton, Ohio.&#x201c;Of the major natural catastrophes of the early twentieth century, the Great Flood of 1913 is one of the least remembered. Over several days in March of that year, heavy rains with fierce winds and tornadoes caused severe flooding in 14 states. Before the storm abated, rain turned to snow. Every major river east of the Mississippi rose, many bridges washed away, and fallen telegraph and telephone lines isolated towns and cities in need of outside help. Hundreds of people died between Nebraska and Vermont from drowning,fires, freezing temperatures, accidents, and suicide. Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania were the hardest-hit states. <strong>Williams weaves tragic and heroic stories of people in the various affected states into an almost hour-by-hour account of the deadly storm. This quick-reading history published for the storm&#x2019;s centennial should interest readers who enjoyed Erik Larson&#x2019;s <em>Isaac&#x2019;s Storm</em> about the Galveston hurricane of 1900 or Simon Winchester&#x2019;s <em>A Crack in the Edge of the World</em> about the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.</strong>&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Deeply researched, personal accounts of the Midwestern natural disaster whose ramifications can be felt today. Journalist Williams offers an eerily prescient work that comes in the wake of another storm of the century, Hurricane Sandy. In mid-March 1913, a series of tornadoes accompanied by a deluge of rain on saturated, thawing ground caused inordinate damage to a swath of Ohio and Indiana, impacting both neighboring states and those as far away as Vermont and New Jersey and leaving approximately 1,000 dead and untold damage to the heartland. Williams has delved into the archives and extracted the stories of survivors and many who perished, tragedies witnessed by many and recorded in newspapers, books and memories passed down.&nbsp; A well-honed chronicle of a significant national disaster, especially timely following the destruction of Sandy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong></p><h2>That This (New Directions Books)</h2><p><p><strong>Susan Howe&#x2019;s newest book of poetry is a revelation as well as a mystery.</strong></p> "What treasures of knowledge we cluster around." <em>That This</em> is a collection in three pieces. "Disappearance Approach," an essay about Howe's husband's sudden death&#x2015;"land of darkness or darkness itself you shadow mouth"&#x2015;begins the book with paintings by Poussin, an autopsy, Sarah Edwards and her sister-in-law Hannah, phantoms, and elusive remnants. "Frolic Architecture," the second section&#x2015;inspired by visits to the vast 18th-century Jonathan Edwards archives at the Beinecke and accompanied by six photograms by James Welling&#x2015;presents hauntingly lovely, oblique type-collages of Hannah Edwards Wetmore's diary entries that Howe (with scissors, "invisible" Scotch Tape, and a Canon copier) has twisted, flattened, and snipped into inscapes of force. The final section, "That This," delivers beautiful short squares of verse that might look at home in a hymnal, with their orderly appearance packing startling power:<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this book is a history of<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a shadow that is a shadow of<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me mystically one in another<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another another to subserve.

In this very beautiful four-part book, Howe (Souls of the Labadie Tract) seeks to come to terms with the sudden death of her third husband, the philosopher and scholar Peter H. Hare. The four sections take radically different formal "approaches" to his loss, in the sense of going backwards in time, to the days just before Hare's fatal embolism, and in the sense of finding a means of understanding, or at least of moving forward. The first section uses a simple, diaristic prose through which Howe incorporates the terse capitals of Hare's autopsy, along with a variety of 18th-century epistolary condolences. The result conveys Howe's sense of "being present at a point of absence where crossing centuries may prove to be like crossing languages." The next section, "Frolic Architecture," comprises densely layered photocopied text fragments whose three-dimensional quality seems to extend into a fourth&#x2014;time. The title section follows with seven pages of strophic, hymnlike verse, where "Grass angels perish in this// harmonic collision because/ non-being cannot be �this.'&nbsp;" By the final, untitled collage, Howe has made her grief speak as much through textual interstices and shifts in diction and form as through each singular elegy.

My hair is tangled in the strap of my messenger bag, my shoes are untied, and I have no idea how I'm going to get to my locker without getting caught. I have to try because I need those chemistry notes. </p> <p>Technically I needed them last night when I'd actually had time to study for my midterm, but I didn't think it was a big deal. I know the material, and I figured I could do a little last-minute cramming during first period homeroom. It was a decent plan until my phone battery died, taking my morning alarm down with it. Now I'll be lucky to catch the last ten minutes of first period.</p> <p>I hop the curb and slow as I slide into the shadow of the ancient brick school. It's probably not classy to barrel through the door like an escaped convict. Of course, it probably wasn't classy flying into the parking lot doing Mach 2 either.</p> <p>I check my barely charged phone for the time as I climb the first step. My foot slips on something halfway up the stairs. It's like hitting a patch of ice. I lunge for the handrail and jerk myself upright, glaring down at the thing that tripped me-a dropped notebook.</p> <p>Nothing special. It's a plain, spiral-bound pad, the kind you can get on sale at the drugstore for less than a buck. Pretty much worthless, except I know it's probably chock-full of notes. Notes someone will likely need during midterm week.</p> <p>Oh, fine.</p> <p>I snatch the notebook off the steps and shove it into my bag. Lost and Found is going to have to wait though. It's in the student store, which is on the opposite side of the school.</p> <p>I climb the rest of the stairs and pull the heavy door open. It shuts behind me with a low whump, and warm, oil-soap tinged air closes around me. The office waits to my left, and the main hallway, long and dim, leads to classrooms and stairwells. My fingers and cheeks tingle, recovering from the bite of the wind.</p> <p>When this hallway is empty, the stillness feels like something that lives and breathes. And waits. I shake it off and rush into the front office. Showing up late to class is bad enough. Showing up without a pass will land me in detention.</p> <p>Mrs. Bluth and Mrs. Pruitt sit behind the high wooden counter, two round-faced mom types who, as far as I can tell, never leave this room. When we were freshmen, Manny and I used to take bets on whether or not they took bathroom breaks.</p> <p>"Good morning, Piper," Mrs. Bluth says, her smile bright. She pushes the sign-in clipboard toward me. "Yearbook assignment this morning?"</p> <p>Why didn't I think of that? I spend countless hours here taking pictures of one thing or another for the yearbook. I shake my head though, and wait while she writes my pass.</p> <p>"Now, straight to class. If you need to visit your locker, you can do so between periods."</p> <p>"Sure." I force a smile though my shoulders sag. Honestly, I should have given up on the ride here. It's not like I'd have enough time to really look anything over. There are nineteen minutes left in the period, and my locker is twelve thousand miles away from everything else. Seriously, I should get PE credit for the hike. Even if I did sneak up there unnoticed, I'd only have fifteen minutes to study while pretending I'm paying attention.</p> <p>Not worth it.</p> <p>I arrive at homeroom where Mr. Stiers is passing out packets to the class. The second I step inside, he swivels on his feet, dark eyes fixing on me.</p> <p>"Good morning, Piper."</p> <p>He takes my pass with a smile. My lips twitch in response. Sad effort, but it's all I've got.</p> <p>"Hey," I say. "Sorry I'm late."</p> <p>"No problem. I'm glad you're here. I didn't want you to miss the senior project talk."</p> <p>Ah, Mr. Stiers. Fluent in five languages and a world traveler, he still ended up in Nowhere, Indiana, teaching high schoolers.</p> <p>I plod to my seat and Manny looks up from the desk behind mine when I set down my bag. He smirks, tapping his bare wrist to note my timing. Still, he offers me an extra packet, and I mouth a "thank you" in return.</p> <p>Mr. Stiers points at a projected image on the wall that probably matches a page inside my packet. "Now that we're well into November, it's time to get serious about these senior projects."</p> <p>I tune him out right there and then. I've known what I was going to do since summer-the epidemic of poverty in small-town Indiana. I've got this covered. Chemistry? Not so much.</p> <p>I unzip my bag, rifling through stuff that's worthless right now: proof sheets from the homecoming dance, my history textbook-might be useful if I hadn't already taken that test-an extra lens cap. My fingers close around a slim, spiral-bound spine. That notebook I found.</p> <p>I pull it out. Maybe, by some stroke of cosmic luck, it's someone else's AP chemistry notes. Fat chance, but I'm desperate.</p> <p>I open the book and frown at the three large words handwritten on the inside of the cover.</p> <p>Malum Non Vide</p> <p>Great. Latin notes. I think it's Latin, anyway. Regardless, it's useless to me.</p> <p>I sigh, running a finger down the cardboard pocket insert that protects the first page. Funny. I've never seen anyone use these stupid things, but I can feel a thick lump in this one. I pull back the cardboard far enough to see what's inside-pictures. A whole stack of them. A photographer not checking out a stack of prints is about as likely as a cat resisting an open can of tuna. It's not exactly snooping, more like creative curiosity.</p> <p>I slide a couple of photos out by the edges. Poor quality black and white snapshots taken around the school from what I can tell. I straighten the top photo to get a better look. It's Isaac Cooper...but it's wrong.</p> <p>Isaac's eyes are empty. White sockets glare out at me, windows to a place where Isaac's soul used to be.</p> <p>I feather my thumb over the face, feeling the jagged scrapes and tears in the photo. The eyes weren't just colored over-they were gouged out. And someone took their time about it, picking out bits of iris and pupil, leaving nothing but a pale oval framed by his eyelids.</p> <p>A chill ghosts up my spine, nesting in the hair at the nape of my neck.</p> <p>Who would do this? I try to picture it; someone hunched over with a needle, scratching away. The image sends my stomach into free fall.</p> <p>I flip to the next picture. Anna Price. Her eyes are gone too. I keep flipping-Kristen, Ming, that guy who always seems to be dating one of the cheerleaders. Three more pictures. Six more gaping holes where eyes should be. My heart beats faster, pushing ice into my veins.</p> <p>I put the pictures back with shaking hands.</p> <p>What the hell kind of book is this?</p> <p>Halloween prank. Has to be. It was only last month, after all. I check the pages after the divider. No more pictures and no more Latin, but every line is filled with narrow, precise writing.</p> <p>Tuesday, 9/5</p> <p>WhtCrane stole cash from cafeteria register</p> <p>Lincoln caught drinking, CCR didn't report</p> <p>RTN fwds pictures of penis to freshman girls</p> <p>The class chuckles and my head snaps up, a counterfeit smile forming on my mouth.</p> <p>Never mind that I have no idea what's so funny. Never mind that I can't imagine anybody buying this smile anyway, since I'm sure I look like someone's got a gun pressed to my temple.</p> <p>I shouldn't have this book. I don't know who wrote this, but they could be in this classroom. The thought makes me cold. But no one's looking. And my eyes drag down again.</p> <p>Wednesday, 9/6</p> <p>Magpie threatens to stab WTR in the neck with a pen</p> <p>Snakchrm calls Wisguy Homo in Bathroom</p> <p>Friday, 9/8</p> <p>Tricky dealing Happy Pills behind bleachers during lunch period</p> <p>Okay, it's not real. These aren't even real names-they're like gamer handles. For all I know, this is some role-playing thing, or a fantasy football team.</p> <p>Yes, because nothing says let's-talk-touchdowns quite like photograph mutilation and a sin diary. I flip through the book, determined to find who's behind this-or proof that it's a joke.</p> <p>The last entry is twenty pages in. It's from yesterday.</p> <p>Tuesday, 11/16</p> <p>Gemini hits RJG's car in parking lot-denies incident</p> <p>Okay, that actually happened. I mean, I didn't see it, but I heard Shane Haywood and some girl I didn't recognize fighting in the parking lot yesterday at lunch. He was pointing at his back fender, claiming something about her paint color. Apparently, no one saw anything.</p> <p>Except that's not true, is it? Obviously someone did see-someone who's keeping a list and checking it twice.</p> <p>And carving up eyes in his spare time.</p> <p>I close the notebook, pressing cold, damp hands into the cover. Time to get a grip. I'm not the girl who covers my eyes during scary movies. I'm the one who tells everyone where the special effects suck.</p> <p>The pictures are creepy, but I can name a handful of kids in this school that I'm pretty sure are future felons. I still sit in class with them every day. So, what's my problem? I'm afraid of scary, white eyes? I'm shocked at the seedy underbelly of Claireville High? It's not like I live in some rainbows-and-sunshine version of this place. I've personally seen how bad these people can get.</p> <p>I guess I just didn't know anyone else really noticed.</p> <p>The book is closed, but I can still see the pictures, the black writing crawling across the pages like veins. I slide the book back into my bag and flip open the senior project packet, but I can't read anything for the chill running up the length of my spine.</p> <p>Mr. Stiers is almost finished presenting, but I feign fascination. Because I'm not bothered. And I definitely don't feel like anyone's watching me.</p> <p>� � �</p> <p>My shoulder blades smack the back of my chair when the bell rings. People tumble from the desks around me, stacking books and tapping pencils, shoving into everything and everyone on their way to the door. Manny knocks on my desk and waves on his way out, but I sit frozen to my chair.</p> <p>I have an AP chemistry test in seven minutes.</p> <p>Okay. Not the best morning, but I've dealt with worse. I know the material. I'll probably pull a B, which isn't the A that I wanted, but still.</p> <p>I grab my bag and apologize to Mr. Stiers again on my way out. The hallway surges in its typical between-periods way, people streaming in every direction. It's like being in a wad of used chewing gum-the walls are a graying pink, and everything I touch is disturbingly sticky.</p> <p>I put my chin up and try to stay positive. In six months, this place will be a distant memory. A couple of months after that, I'll be on my way to a photography degree at NYU, maybe even Columbia. That's when my real life starts and I can't wait.</p> <p>I focus all my energy into looking like a girl on a mission as I move down the hall, pushing through clusters of conversation and banging locker doors, taking the steps to the second floor two at a time. Kristen Green's just outside the restroom. She's ripping another price tag off another pair of jeans that I'd bet a million dollars she didn't actually buy. She catches my eye and immediately checks her hair.</p> <p>Hazard of being a school photographer, I guess-the pretty ones always check their hair. Even before they check to see if I have my camera.</p> <p>They also suck in their nonexistent guts and try to present me with their best side. If I ever manage to get a picture of a group of these girls without one of them over-posing, I'll nominate myself for a Pulitzer.</p> <p>I check the clock above the gymnasium hallway. Six minutes. I'm making good time.</p> <p>I find my locker, putting English books away and pulling out a couple of fresh pencils. Just need to grab my notes. I'll look them over on the way.</p> <p>Beside me, a slim hand with bright red nails reaches for the locker next to mine.</p> <p>Stella DuBois.</p> <p>Stella never checks her hair. But then, she doesn't need to, because she always looks like she just stepped out of a Pantene commercial.</p> <p>"Have any Hollywood directors called yet?"</p> <p>The question is loud, but Stella stays silent, twirling her combination lock with her crimson-tipped fingers. She tucks some long red strands behind her ear and pretends she can't sense the person who's standing right behind her. The one who's obviously talking to her.</p> <p>"No? I'll bet someone will be calling. Maybe a 1-900 number," the same someone says. I'm pretty sure it's Jackson Pierce. I really don't have time for an in-crowd peacock session, so I search a little more frantically through a couple of folders, finding nothing. What is with this day?</p> <p>"I can't decide which performance I like better," he goes on. "What about you, Tate?"</p> <p>"Good question," someone, probably Tate, answers. He's quieter. Sounds pissed off.</p> <p>I risk a glance over my shoulder to be sure. Dark hair and a linebacker's shoulders-yeah, it's Jackson. He's flanked by Tate Donovan and Nick Patterson. Tate and Nick are both taller and blond, but Tate's got a model's face, all sharp lines and cool eyes, the complete opposite of Nick's dimpled smile and perpetually messy hair.</p> <p>Tate looks like he might stroke out on the floor. Nick looks...well, kind of oblivious. It actually seems like he's watching me. Which isn't likely.</p> <p>I turn around, searching for whoever Nick's gaze is aimed at, but I just see Stella. She's shoving papers in her locker now, still pretending to be deaf. I don't get it. The trio of jock junk behind me is the "trifecta of hot" around here, according to most. They're also her people, so this whole showdown is beyond weird.</p> <p>But not interesting enough to make me late for my test. Ugh, where the hell are those notes?</p> <p>"Maybe we should watch the videos again," Tate says, voice cutting like a blade.</p> <p>"Again," Jackson says, obviously delighted with that particular word. "Oh God, oh God, again!" Jackson's voice drags out that last again in a way that tells me everything about the content of Stella's video.</p> <p>I find my notes, but I don't feel triumphant. And I'm not as uninterested as I'd like. My throat's tight as I glance at Stella. She's perfectly still, like she's not even hearing this, but everyone is hearing this.</p> <p>Time to go. Way past time. I chance a quick look over my shoulder to find a semicircle of students gathering, watching intently.</p> <p>Jackson's eyes are black and bright, a weird contrast to Tate's grimace. And then there's Nick, who now looks completely shocked, like he's only just figured out what's going on here. I don't know, maybe he's the pretty-but-dumb type, but come on. This has had "torture session" written all over it since Jackson opened his mouth.</p> <p>"We should go," Nick says, shifting on his feet and glancing at the ancient clock overhead. "We've got class."</p> <p>"Too bad Stella isn't interested in class," Tate says. Jackson hums in agreement and-crack! I jump, my gaze darting to Stella's locker door, which is swinging right back open despite the impact of her slamming it shut.</p> <p>All around, I hear people pause, conversations dropping into nothingness. Stella clenches her teeth so hard a muscle in her jaw jumps.</p> <p>I look for an escape route and find Nick's eyes ...</p></p><h2>Where You Work Matters: Student Affairs Administration at Different Types of Institutions (American College Personnel Association Series)</h2><p>This volume challenges the widely held assumption that the professional practice of student affairs administration transcends the influence of organizational culture. Based on data and commentaries from more than 1,100 practitioners, this book describes how the experience of student affairs administrators varies by institutional type. The findings paint a multifaceted and integrated portrait of the profession. For instance, the standard bearers at liberal art colleges share as much in common with the generalists at comprehensive institutions as they do with the interpreters at religiously affiliated campuses. The specialists at research universities are juxtaposed against the producers at community colleges, however they have closer ties to the change agents at Hispanic-serving institutions. The work of the guardians at historically Black colleges and universities is linked to practice at both liberal arts and community colleges. <i>Where You Work Matters</i> offers current and future administrators a greater appreciation for the vibrancy and complexity of the student affairs profession.</p><p><b>Joan B. Hirt</b> is Associate Professor in the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at Virginia Tech.Hirt's extensive research as conveyed in <i>Where You Work Matters</i> promises to make a significant contribution to the student affairs field for years to come.

Within days Emma's husband, Jacob, is forced to disappear underground, leaving her imprisoned within the city's decrepit, moldering Jewish ghetto. But then, in the dead of night, the resistance smuggles her out. Taken to Krakow to live with Jacob's Catholic aunt, Krysia, Emma takes on a new identity as Anna Lipowski, a gentile. </p><p>Emma's already precarious situation is complicated by her introduction to Kommandant Richwalder, a high-ranking Nazi official who hires her to work as his assistant.

As the atrocities of war intensify, so does Emma's relationship with the Kommandant, building to a climax that will risk not only her double life, but also the lives of those she loves.</p></p><p><p>Pam Jenoff is the author of several novels, including the international bestseller The Kommandant's Girl, which also earned her a Quill Award nomination. Pam lives with her husband and three children near Philadelphia where, in addition to writing, she teaches law school.</p><p>As we cut across the wide span of the market square, past the pigeons gathered around fetid puddles, I eye the sky warily and tighten my grip on Lukasz's hand, willing him to walk faster. But the child licks his ice-cream cone, oblivious to the darkening sky, a drop hanging from his blond curls. Thank God for his blond curls. A sharp March wind gusts across the square, and I fight the urge to let go of his hand and draw my threadbare coat closer around me.</p> <p>We pass through the high center arch of the Sukennice, the massive yellow mercantile hall that bisects the square. It is still several blocks to Nowy Kleparz, the outdoor market on the far northern edge of Kraków's city center, and already I can feel Lukasz's gait slowing, his tiny, thin-soled shoes scuffing harder against the cobblestones with every step. I consider car-rying him, but he is three years old and growing heavier by the day. Well fed, I might have managed it, but now I know that I would make it a few meters at most. If only he would go faster. <i>"Szybko, kochana,"</i> I plead with him under my breath. <i>"Chocz!"</i> His steps seem to lighten as we wind our way through the flower vendors peddling their wares in the shadow of the Mariacki Cathedral spires. </p> <p>Moments later, we reach the far side of the square and I feel a familiar rumble under my feet. I pause. I have not been on a trolley in almost a year. I imagine lifting Lukasz onto the streetcar and sinking into a seat, watching the buildings and people walking below as we pass. We could be at the market in minutes. Then I stop, shake my head inwardly. The ink on our new papers is barely dry, and the wonder on Lukasz's face at his first trolley ride would surely arouse suspicion. I cannot trade our safety for convenience. We press onward.</p> <p>Though I try to remind myself to keep my head low and avoid eye contact with the shoppers who line the streets this midweek morning, I cannot help but drink it all in. It has been more than a year since I was last in the city center. I inhale deeply. The air, damp from the last bits of melting snow, is perfumed with the smell of roasting chestnuts from the cor-ner kiosk. Then the trumpeter in the cathedral tower begins to play the <i>hejnal,</i> the brief melody he sends across the square every hour on the hour to commemorate the Tartar invasion of Kraków centuries earlier. I resist the urge to turn back to-ward the sound, which greets me like an old friend.</p> <p>As we approach the end of Florianska Street, Lukasz sud-denly freezes, tightening his grip on my hand. I look down. He has dropped the last bit of his precious ice-cream cone on the pavement but does not seem to notice. His face, already pale from months of hiding indoors, has turned gray. "What is it?" I whisper, crouching beside him, but he does not re-spond. I follow his gaze to where it is riveted. Ten meters ahead, by the arched entrance to the medieval Florian Gate, stand two Nazis carrying machine guns. Lukasz shudders. "There, there,<i> kochana.</i> It's okay." I put my arms around his shoulders, but there is nothing I can do to soothe him. His eyes dart back and forth, and his mouth moves without sound. "Come." I lift him up and he buries his head in my neck. I look around for a side street to take, but there is none and turn-ing around might attract attention. With a furtive glance to make sure no one is watching, I push the remnants of the ice-cream cone toward the gutter with my foot and proceed past the Nazis, who do not seem to notice us. A few minutes later, when I feel the child breathing calmly again, I set him down.</p> <p>Soon we approach the Nowy Kleparz market. It is hard to contain my excitement at being out again, walking and shop-ping like a normal person. As we navigate the narrow walk-ways between the stalls, I hear people complaining. The cabbage is pale and wilted, the bread hard and dry; the meat, what there is of it, is from an unidentifiable source and already giving off a curious odor. To the townspeople and villagers, still accustomed to the prewar bounty of the Polish country-side, the food is an abomination. To me, it is paradise. My stomach tightens.</p> <p>"Two loaves," I say to the baker, keeping my head low as I pass him my ration cards. A curious look crosses his face. It is your imagination, I tell myself. Stay calm. To a stranger, I know, I look like any other Pole. My coloring is fair, my ac-cent flawless, my dress purposefully nondescript. Krysia chose this market in a working-class neighborhood on the northern edge of town deliberately, knowing that none of my former acquain-tances from the city would shop here. It is critical that no one recognize me.</p> <p>I pass from stall to stall, reciting the groceries we need in my head: flour, some eggs, a chicken, if there is one to be had. I have never made lists, a fact that serves me well now that paper is so dear. The shopkeepers are kind, but businesslike. Six months into the war, food is in short supply; there is no generous cut of cheese for a smile, no sweet biscuit for the child with the large blue eyes. Soon I have used all of our ration cards, yet the bas-ket remains half empty. We begin the long walk home.</p> <p>Still feeling the chill from the wind on the market square, I lead Lukasz through side streets on our way back across town. A few minutes later, we turn onto Grodzka Street, a wide thoroughfare lined with elegant shops and houses. I hesitate. I had not meant to come here. My chest tightens, making it hard to breathe. Easy, I tell myself, you can do this. It is just another street. I walk a few meters farther, then stop. I am standing before a pale yellow house with a white door and wooden flower boxes in the windows. My eyes travel upward to the second floor. A lump forms in my throat, making it dif-ficult to swallow. Don't, I think, but it is too late. This was Ja-cob's house. Our house. </p> <p>I met Jacob eighteen months ago while I was working as a clerk in the university library. It was a Friday afternoon, I re-member, because I was rushing to update the book catalog and get home in time for Shabbes. "Excuse me," a deep voice said. I looked up from my work, annoyed at the interruption. The speaker was of medium height and wore a small yarmulke and closely trimmed beard and mustache. His hair was brown with flecks of red. "Can you recommend a good book?"</p> <p>"A good book?" I was caught off guard as much by the swim-ming darkness of his eyes as by the generic nature of his request.</p> <p>"Yes, I would like something light to read over the week-end to take my mind off my studies. Perhaps the Iliad, ?"</p> <p>I could not help laughing. "You consider Homer light read-ing?"</p> <p>"Relative to physics texts, yes." The corners of his eyes crin-kled. I led him to the literature section, where he settled upon a volume of Shakespeare's comedies. Our knuckles brushed as I handed him the book, sending a chill down my spine. I checked out the book to him, but still he lingered. I learned that his name was Jacob and that he was twenty, two years my senior.</p> <p>After that, he came to visit me daily. I quickly learned that even though he was a science major, his real passion was poli-tics and that he was involved with many activist groups. He wrote pieces, published in student and local newspapers, that were critical not only of the Polish government, but of what he called "Germany's unfettered dominance" over its neighbors. I worried that it was dangerous to be so outspoken. While the Jews of my neighborhood argued heatedly on their front stoops, outside the synagogues and in the stores about current affairs and everything else, I was raised to believe that it was safer to keep one's voice low when dealing with the outside world. But Jacob, the son of prominent sociologist Maximillian Bau, had no such concerns, and as I listened to him speak, watched his eyes burn and his hands fly, I forgot to be afraid.</p> <p>I was amazed that a student from a wealthy, secular family would be interested in me, the daughter of a poor Orthodox baker, but if he noticed the difference in our backgrounds, it did not seem to matter. We began spending our Sunday af-ternoons together, talking and strolling along the Wisla River. "I should be getting home," I remarked one Sunday afternoon in April as the sky grew dusky. Jacob and I had been walking along the river path where it wound around the base of Wawel Castle, talking so intensely I had lost track of time. "My par-ents will be wondering where I am."</p> <p>"Yes, I should meet them soon," he replied matter-of-factly. I stopped in my tracks. "That's what one does, isn't it, when one wants to ask permission to court?" I was too sur-prised to answer. Though Jacob and I had spent much time together these recent months and I knew he enjoyed my com-pany, I somehow never thought that he would seek permis-sion to see me formally. He reached down and took my chin in his gloved fingers. Softly, he pressed his lips down on mine for the first time. Our mouths lingered together, lips slightly parted. The ground seemed to slide sideways, and I felt so dizzy I was afraid that I might faint. </p> <p>Thinking now of Jacob's kiss, I feel my legs grow warm. Stop it, I tell myself, but it is no use. It has been nearly six months since I have seen my husband, been touched by him. </p><p>A sharp clicking noise jars me from my thoughts. My vi-sion clears and I find myself still standing in front of the yel-low house, staring upward. The front door opens and an older, well-dressed woman steps out. Noticing me and Lukasz, she hesitates. I can tell she is wondering who we are, why we have stopped in front of her house. Then she turns from us dismis-sively, locks the door and proceeds down the steps. This is her home now. Enough, I tell myself sharply. I cannot afford to do anything that will draw attention. I shake my head, trying to clear the image of Jacob from my mind. </p> <p>"Come, Lukasz," I say aloud, tugging gently on the child's hand. We continue walking and soon cross the Planty, the broad swath of parkland that rings the city center. The trees are revealing the most premature of buds, which will surely be cut down by a late frost. Lukasz tightens his grip on my hand, staring wide-eyed at the few squirrels that play among the bushes as though it is already spring. As we push onward, I feel the city skyline receding behind us. Five minutes later we reach the Aleje, the wide boulevard that, if taken to the left, leads south across the river. I stop and look toward the bridge. Just on the other side, a half kilometer south, lies the ghetto. I start to turn in that direction, thinking of my parents. Per-haps if I go to the wall, I can see them, find a way to slip them some of the food I have just purchased. Krysia would not mind. Then I stop&#x2014;I cannot risk it, not in broad daylight, not with the child. I feel shame at my stomach, which no longer twists with hunger, and at my freedom, at crossing the street as though the occupation and the war do not exist. </p> <p>Half an hour later, Lukasz and I reach Chelmska, the rural neighborhood we have come to call home. My feet are sore from walking along the uneven dirt road and my arms ache from carrying the groceries, as well as the child, for the last several meters. As we round the corner where the main road divides in two, I inhale deeply; the air has grown colder now, its pureness broken only by an acrid hint of smoke from a farmer burning piles of dead winter brush. I can see the fires smoldering across the sloping farmland to my right, their thick smoke fanning out over the fields that roll like a gentle green lake into the horizon. </p></p><h2>Napoleon&#39;s Wars: An International History</h2><p><b>A glorious?and conclusive?chronicle of the wars waged by one of the most polarizing figures in military history</b><br><br>Acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic as a new standard on the subject, this sweeping, boldly written history of the Napoleonic era reveals its central protagonist as a man driven by an insatiable desire for fame, and determined ?to push matters to extremes.? More than a myth-busting portrait of Napoleon, however, it offers a panoramic view of the armed conflicts that spread so quickly out of revolutionary France to countries as remote as Sweden and Egypt. As it expertly moves through conflicts from Russia to Spain, <i>Napoleon?s Wars</i> proves to be history writing equal to its subject?grand and ambitious?that will reframe the way this tumultuous era is understood.</p><p><b>Charles Esdaile</b> is Professor of History at the University of Liverpool. His <i>The Peninsular War</i> was acclaimed by many reviewers, including Andrew Roberts and Bernard Cornwell.Napoleon impressed his will on an entire era in European history, but his destiny, and France&#39;s, were also shaped by Europe&#39;s reigning figures and competing national interests. Esdaile puts Napoleon&#39;s career into the context of European politics in this excellent political history and military biography, which is perfectly rendered by the ever-reliable Simon Prebble. Prebble brings a judicious balance to a narrative that is filled with knaves and connivers. The story, though familiar, is compelling, and Esdaile has a fine eye for the contemporary observation or quote. Prebble brings Esdaile&#39;s Napoleon unforgettably to life: ever hungering for glory and unmindful of all else, stubbornly overreaching himself at every turn, relentlessly heading for his own downfall. D.A.W. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Prose</h2><p><p>Elizabeth Bishop's prose is not nearly as well known as her poetry, but she was a dazzling and compelling prose writer too, as the publication of her letters has shown. Her stories are often on the borderline of memoir, and vice versa. From her college days, she could find the most astonishing yet thoroughly apt metaphors to illuminate her ideas. This volume&#x2015;edited by the poet, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning critic, and Bishop scholar Lloyd Schwartz&#x2015;includes virtually all her published shorter prose pieces and a number of prose works not published until after her death. Here are her famous as well as her lesser-known stories, crucial memoirs, literary and travel essays, book reviews, and&#x2015;for the first time&#x2015;her original draft of <i>Brazil</i>, the Time/Life volume she repudiated in its published version, and the correspondence between Bishop and the poet Anne Stevenson, the author of the first book-length volume devoted to Bishop.</p></p><p><p><b>Elizabeth Bishop</b> (1911&#x2013;79) won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award.</p>Starred Review. The most exciting part of the Bishop reissue project may be this volume, which contains all of the prose published in her lifetime, as well as a few hard to find things and a thing or two you won't find anywhere else. As a frequent contributor to the New Yorker (the poet's decades-long relationship with the magazine is brought to life in The Complete Correspondence) and other publications, Bishop crafted all kinds of prose, from autobiographical short stories ("In the Village") to loving reminiscences ("Efforts of Affection: A Memoir of Marianne Moore"); she was as original a prose writer as she was a poet, an under-known fact this volume may help solidify once and for all. The real gem of this book is "Brazil," a book-length essay on Bishop's adopted homeland, whose published version, which came out as a Time-Life guide, Bishop hated. Here we have her original draft, written in her inimitable style: "The history of South America in the nineteenth century resembles Shakespeare's battle scenes: shouts and trumpets; small armies on stage, small armies off stage..."

I think my husband, Dave, might be having an affair. I found an earring in his pocket, and it's not mine. I'm also worried because some jewelry was recently stolen from an old woman&#x2014;and Dave used to visit her a lot. <br><br> You see, he's a pastor. And a good man. I <em>can't</em> believe he's guilty of anything, but why won't he tell me where he's been when he comes home so late?<br><br> Reader, I'd love to hear what you think. I also want to tell you what's going on with your other friends in Cedar Cove. <br><br> Like Sheriff Troy Davis, to mention one. His long-ago love, Faith Beckwith, just moved here!<br><br> So come on in and join me for a cup of tea. <br><br>Emily Flemming<br></p><p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide. Her work has appeared on every major bestseller list, with more than 170 million copies in print, and she is a multiple award winner. The Hallmark Channel based a television series on Debbie&#x2019;s popular Cedar Cove books. For more information, visit her website, www.debbiemacomber.com.<br><br>They say the wife is always the last to know.<br><br>Except that Emily Flemming did know and she'd known for more than a week. Dave, her husband, was involved with someone else. Only Dave wasn't just Dave Flemming. He was <em>Pastor </em>Dave Flemming. The thought that her husband loved another woman was intolerable, unthinkable, unbearable. Dave's betrayal was bad enough, but disregarding his moral obligations to his congregation and his God&#x2014;she could hardly believe it. This shocking secret was completely inconsistent with everything she knew about her husband.<br><br>Ever since the night of their anniversary dinner, Emily had carefully guarded what she'd learned. She'd been in the church office, waiting for Dave, and had reached for his suit jacket, which hung on the back of his door. When she draped it over her arm, a diamond earring had fallen out of the pocket. Later she'd discovered the second one in the other pocket. Emily had certainly never owned anything as extravagant as this pair of large, diamond-studded pendant earrings.<br><br>In the beginning Emily had assumed the earrings were an anniversary present; however, she quickly realized they couldn't be. For one thing, they weren't in a jeweler's box. But even if they had been, it wasn't possible. Dave could never have afforded diamond earrings on their tight family budget.<br><br>Emily should have asked immediately...and hadn't. She'd been afraid of ruining their special evening with her suspicions. But almost at once, other details had begun to add up in her mind. She could no longer ignore the fact that Dave so often worked late, especially since the private hour they'd shared after dinner had gone by the wayside. It might've been her imagination but he seemed to take extra long with his grooming, too.<br><br>Her suspicions doubled and tripled. She held them close to her heart, examining them over and over, trying to make sense of her husband's behavior. Whenever she asked where he'd been, Dave's answers were vague. Another warning sign...<br><br>"Mommy, when's Daddy coming home?" Mark, the younger of her two sons, asked as he looked up from his plate. He was eight and his dark brown eyes were identical to his father's.<br><br>Emily had the same question. "Soon," she said as reassuringly as she could. Two or three times a week, Dave didn't get home until well after dinner. At first she'd made excuses for him to their boys. Now she didn't know what to tell them.<br><br>"Dad hardly ever eats with us," Matthew complained, sitting down next to his younger brother.<br><br>Dave's lateness had started gradually. He used to make a point of being there for the evening meal. As she stared into space, Emily couldn't help wondering if he was having dinner with some other woman... some other family. She chased away the thought with a determination that stiffened her spine.<br><br>For the sake of her children, Emily dragged out her standard excuse. "Your father's been busy at the church."<br><br>"Every night?"<br><br>Her sons echoed Emily's own dissatisfaction. "It seems so," she returned lightly, pretending all was well as she joined them at the dinner table. They automatically clasped hands and bowed their heads while Emily recited grace. Silently she added a prayer for herself, asking for courage to face whatever the future might hold for her marriage.<br><br>"Shouldn't we wait for him at least one night?" Mark said as he reluctantly picked up his fork.<br><br>"You two have homework, don't you?" she asked, ignoring his question.<br><br>"But Dad&#x2014;"<br><br>"Your father will eat later."<br><br>"Will he get home before we go to bed?" Matthew, her sensitive son, asked.<br><br>"I don't know," she said, swallowing hard.<br><br>She made a pretense of eating. Her appetite had disappeared the minute she'd found those diamond earrings. That was the start&#x2014;the wake-up call she'd ignored for months. Naturally, she'd told herself, there could be any number of explanations for those earrings. She'd intended to ask him about it the very next day... and hadn't.<br><br>Emily knew what held her back. She didn't want to hear the truth; she simply wasn't ready for it. She dreaded the consequences once she did finally confront him.<br><br>She'd questioned her husband, more than once, about his late nights. But Dave brushed aside her concern and offered ambiguous excuses, mentioning people she'd never met and meetings she didn't know about. He almost seemed to resent her asking, so after a while she'd stopped.<br><br>She supposed she had her answer. Since the discovery of the diamond earrings, she had a perfectly clear picture of what was happening&#x2014;what had already happened. Sadly, pastors were as susceptible to temptation as anyone else. Like all sinners, they, too, could be lured into affairs. They, too, could make irreparable mistakes.<br><br>If Emily had hoped this was just a misunderstanding, that she'd allowed it to grow out of all proportion in her mind, those hopes had been destroyed. Earlier in the week, she'd run into Bob and Peggy Beldon at the grocery store. They owned the local bed-and-breakfast, Thyme and Tide. As the three of them stood in the middle of the aisle exchanging pleasantries, Bob casually said that he missed playing golf with Dave.<br><br>As long as the weather permitted, the two of them had played weekly for the past three years. In a matter of minutes, she'd ferreted out the information she'd been afraid to learn. Dave had given up golfing more than a year ago. A year! Yet every week last summer, he'd loaded up his golf clubs on Monday afternoons and driven off, supposedly to meet Bob. Obviously he'd been meeting someone else.<br><br>Emily sighed. She couldn't continue to let her mind wander down this well-traveled path of doubt and suspicion. Half the time she acted the role of the quiet, unassuming wife; the rest of the time it was all she could do to refrain from <em>demanding </em>an explanation. She wanted the truth no matter how painful it might be&#x2014;and yet she didn't. What wife ever did?<br><br>So far she'd remained silent. She was astonished by how good she'd become at pretending everything was fine. None of her friends suspected. What bothered her almost as much as her suspicions was the fact that Dave didn't seem to have any idea that she'd caught on. She wondered if he'd broach the subject. Maybe if he knew she'd figured out what was going on... Perhaps that was what she'd been waiting for. She wanted <em>him </em>to ask <em>her.</em><br><br>But Dave never asked. If she managed to put on a marvelous performance, then so did her husband. Last Sunday he'd actually spoken from the pulpit about the importance of marriage, of loving one's spouse.<br><br>Emily felt like the most unloved woman in the world. She could barely stop herself from breaking into heart-wrenching sobs right there in front of the entire congregation. Naturally everyone must have assumed she'd been overcome with emotion, since Dave's sermon, by implication, had honored her. She wanted to tell them that, beautiful though his words were, that was <em>all </em>they were. Words.<br><br>It was hard to believe this could be happening to them. Emily had always been so sure they had a solid marriage, and that Dave was her best friend. Apparently she was wrong.<br><br>The door leading to the garage opened and to her surprise he walked into the house.<br><br>"Dad!" Mark slid out of his chair, running toward his father as if he hadn't seen him in a year.<br><br>"Hey there, little man, how's it going?" Dave reached down and swung their son into his arms. Mark was too big to be picked up like a child, but he craved the attention from his father.<br><br>Dave kissed Emily on the cheek, then ruffled Matthew's hair before he sat down. "I'm glad I made it home in time for dinner tonight."<br><br>"Me, too," Mark said, his eyes glowing.<br><br>Despite everything, her own happiness sprang to life again, and Emily got up and brought a fourth place setting to the table.<br><br>When she passed him the enchilada casserole she'd made, he took a heaping serving, then grinned over at her. "You fixed one of my favorites," he said. "Thank you."<br><br>"You're welcome." She met his look, letting him know with her eyes how much she loved him. Maybe, regardless of the evidence, all her unhappy suspicions were wrong.<br><br>"Can you help me with my homework after dinner, Dad?" Mark asked.<br><br>Their younger son was the top student in his class, far ahead of the other second-graders. He didn't need any assistance. What he really wanted was time with his father.<br><br>"You promised to throw me the football, remember?" Matthew said. Never mind that it was late November and already dark outside, He, too, wanted time with Dave. The children weren't the only ones; Emily needed all the reassurance he had to offer. Hard as she tried to cast aside these doubts, they refused to die. She didn't want to lose her husband. She loved Dave no matter what and was determined to keep her marriage together&#x2014;or at least make every possible effort.<br><br>"Hold on, hold on." Dave laughingly raised both hands. "Give me a minute to catch my breath, would you?"<br><br>Both boys stared expectantly at their father. Emily couldn't bear to look at their eager faces. Seeing the love for him in their eyes made her feel like weeping.<br><br>"Let your dad eat his dinner," she said.<br><br>"After that, I'll help you both, but I'd like a few minutes alone with your mother first," Dave said, glancing at Emily.<br><br>A chill raced down her spine, and she was afraid to meet his eyes.<br><br>"Aw, Dad," Mark whined.<br><br>"It won't take long," he promised. "Eat your green beans."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>Emily handed Dave the bowl of buttered beans with sliced almonds. He took a small portion. Green beans weren't his favorite vegetable, either, and this was her way of suggesting he set a good example.<br><br>Following dinner, the boys cleared the table, then went to their room for study hour. This had been Dave's idea. Whether they had homework or not, Matthew and Mark were to spend one hour every night reading, writing or reviewing their schoolwork. The television wasn't allowed to be on, nor were video games permitted.<br><br>As the boys trudged to their room, Emily made a pot of coffee, keeping her back to Dave as she worked. Asking to speak to her like that was unusual for him. If there was something on his mind, he generally discussed it with her after the boys had gone to bed.<br><br>Even before she could finish pouring their coffee, Dave asked her, "Are you happy?" His voice was urgent. Intense. The need to know seemed to burn inside him.<br><br>Dozens of possible questions had occurred to her, but this was one she hadn't expected.<br><br>"Happy?" she repeated, facing him. Still not meeting his gaze, she carried two steaming mugs of coffee to the table and set them down. "Am I happy?" She shoved her hands in the back pockets of her faded jeans as she contemplated her response.<br><br>"I didn't think it would take you this long to answer," Dave said. His dark eyes studied her and he seemed disappointed in her hesitation.<br><br>"Is there a reason I shouldn't be happy?" she asked, turning the question back on him. "I live in a beautiful house and I'm able to stay home with the boys the way we both wanted. My husband is madly in love with me, right?" she added, remembering his sermon from the Sunday before&#x2014;and hoping she didn't sound even slightly sarcastic. Without giving him the opportunity to answer, perhaps because she feared what he might say, she asked, "What about you, Dave? Are <em>you </em>happy?"<br><br>"Of course I am." His reply was immediate and impassioned.<br><br>"Then I am, too." Rather than join him at the table she started to load the dishwasher.<br><br>"Sit down," he said. "Please."<br><br>Reluctantly she did.<br><br>"You haven't been sleeping well."<br><br>So he'd noticed. She fell asleep easily enough, but an hour or two later she'd be wide awake. Then for the rest of the night she'd toss and turn, sleeping fitfully if at all. The scenarios that played out in her mind wouldn't allow her to rest<em>. Her husband might be in love with someone else. He might even be cheating on her.</em><br><br>Emily considered herself an emotionally strong woman, one who remained calm in a crisis. A woman others counted on for guidance and support. Yet when it came to confronting her husband with her suspicions, she was a coward.<br><br>"If there's something bothering you, maybe I can help," he said. She recognized his tone, that caring, concerned voice he so often used with others. Only she wasn't just one of his parishioners, she was his wife!<br><br>"What could possibly be bothering me?" she asked airily. She didn't expect him to answer.<br><br>"I don't know. That's why I'm asking. Are the ladies from the missionary society making too many demands?"<br><br>"No." The cookbook committee had wanted her to organize the entire project and she'd told them she simply didn't have the time, which was true. Apparently there'd been more than a few ruffled feathers. The church family seemed to think that because Emily didn't work outside the home, she should be at their beck and call, just like Dave. Emily had no intention of becoming an unpaid employee of the church and had made that clear when they accepted the assignment in Cedar Cove. Her role was to support Dave and mother their young sons.<br><br>"You'd tell me if you were upset, wouldn't you?"<br><br>"Of course," she said, hoping the act of sipping coffee would hide her lie.<br><br>Mark stuck his head inside the kitchen. "Are you finished talking to Mom yet?" he asked his father. "I need help with my math."<br><br>Dave looked at her.<br><br>"I'm fine," she said emphatically.<br><br>He seemed to doubt her. She wasn't expert at lying and hated the fact that she was afraid to voice her concerns. Dave took a sip of his coffee and stood. "All right, Mark, show me what's giving you trouble."<br><br>Emily watched her husband and son walk out of the kitchen and swallowed painfully. She'd been waiting for him to ask her a question like that. <em>Are you happy? </em>It was the perfect opportunity to address her suspicions&#x2014;but she'd been too frightened to say anything.<br><br>The problem, she told herself, was that she wasn't prepared. For her own protection, she needed facts and details before she confronted him. He needed to realize she wasn't as naive as he obviously thought.<br><br>By nine that evening both boys were in bed and asleep. When Dave was home, getting her sons ready for the night was invariably a smooth, easy process. But anytime she was alone with them&#x2014;which was most nights lately&#x2014;they came up with a multitude of excuses to delay going to bed.<br><br>Half an hour later, she was in her sewing room, working on a quilt for Matthew. She ironed the fabric squares, pleased with her bargain. Always conscious of cost, she'd bought the material, a bright cotton print, on sale at The Quilted Giraffe. As she turned off the iron she heard Dave come in. He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind. "Alone at last," he whispered, kissing the side of her neck, his lips lingering there.<br><br></p><h2>Spider&#39;s Trap (13) (Elemental Assassin)</h2><p>The next thrilling book in Jennifer Estep&#x2019;s <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling Elemental Assassin series&#x2014;&#x201c;an extraordinary series....One of the most intriguing heroines in the genre&#x201d; (<i>Romantic Times Book Reviews</i>).<br><br><i>Keep your friends close but your enemies within stabbing distance.<br> </i><br>One important lesson I&#x2019;ve learned in the assassination business is that to be the best you have to roll with the punches.

Normally, slot machines, poker tables, and roulette wheels would have been set up on the deck in preparation for the night&#x2019;s gambling, but today the riverboat was serving as a meeting spot for some of Ashland&#x2019;s many underworld bosses.<br> <br>Supposedly, this meeting was to be a peaceful mediation of a dispute between Dimitri Barkov and Luiz Ramos, two of the city&#x2019;s crime lords, who were disagreeing about who had the right to buy a series of coin laundries to, well, launder the money that they made from their gambling operations. Not that there was anything peaceful about the way Dimitri and Luiz had been standing nose-to-nose and screaming at each other for the last five minutes. Their respective guards stood behind them, fists clenched tightly and shooting dirty looks at each other, as though they would all love nothing more than to start brawling in the middle of the deck.<br> <br>Now, that would be entertaining. I grinned. Maybe I should let them have at each other, gladiator-style. Winner take all. That would be one way to settle things.<br> <br>Silvio nudged me with his elbow, as if he knew exactly what I was thinking. &#x201c;Pay attention. You&#x2019;re supposed to be listening to the facts so you can be fair and impartial, remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I could be fair and impartial in stabbing them both.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave me a chiding look.<br> <br>I sighed. &#x201c;You always ruin my fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my job,&#x201d; the vampire replied.<br> <br>I palmed the silverstone knife hidden up my sleeve&#x2014;the only weapon I&#x2019;d brought on board&#x2014;and flashed it at my friends under the table, out of sight of the bosses and their men.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;Just let me stab one of them. Surely that will shut the other one up too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phillip snickered again, while Silvio let out a small, sad sigh. He wasn&#x2019;t crazy about my managerial style. Couldn&#x2019;t imagine why.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought we agreed that you wouldn&#x2019;t bring any knives on board,&#x201d; Silvio murmured again. &#x201c;So as not to send the wrong message.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I left the other four in the car. So I&#x2019;m only a fifth as deadly today. That&#x2019;s progress, right?&#x201d; I waggled my eyebrows.<br> <br>Silvio narrowed his gray eyes and held out his hand below the table. I reluctantly passed over the weapon, and he tucked it up his sleeve. I pouted a little, but he ignored me. He was getting good at that.<br> <br>My friends turned their attention back to Dimitri and Luiz, who were still yelling and pointing their fingers at each other, each man trying to shout the other one down. But instead of listening to them, I glanced at the third boss who had shown up: Lorelei Parker.<br> <br>Unlike Dimitri and Luiz, who were both dressed in business suits, Lorelei was sporting black stiletto boots, dark jeans, and a long-sleeved T-shirt, just like I was. The only real difference between us was that her leather jacket was a bright royal blue, and mine was a subdued midnight black. Her black hair was pulled back into a French braid, and her blue eyes were focused on her phone, since she was busy texting. The quick motions of her fingers made a silverstone rune ring glitter on her right hand&#x2014;a rose wrapped in thorns dripping blood, all of it outlined in impressive diamonds.<br> <br>Of the three bosses, Lorelei was the most intriguing, since she was a smuggler known far and wide for her ability to get anything for anyone at any time. Cash, guns, precious jewels, and pricey antiques were just a few of the things she was rumored to dabble in.<br> <br>Only a single guard stood off to her side. Jack Corbin, her right-hand man. He too was dressed in boots, jeans, and a black leather jacket, but his blue eyes continuously scanned the deck and everyone and everything on it.<br> <br>Corbin realized that I was watching him and tipped his head at me, before smoothing back his dark brown hair. Then he sidled a little closer to his boss, ready to protect her from everyone on deck, including me. I nodded back at him. My deceased mentor, Fletcher Lane, had a thick file on Corbin in his office, so I knew that he was far more dangerous than he appeared to be.<br> <br>Then again, so was I.<br> <br>Lorelei was here because she owned the coin laundries in question and was more than willing to sell them&#x2014;to the highest bidder, of course. I didn&#x2019;t know if she&#x2019;d approached Dimitri and Luiz about buying the front businesses or if they&#x2019;d come to her, and I hadn&#x2019;t had the chance to ask any questions, since the gangsters had been screaming at each other the entire six minutes I&#x2019;d been on the riverboat. Either way, the men just couldn&#x2019;t agree on who was getting what, and things had escalated to the point where Dimitri and Luiz were about to declare war on each other. That would mean shootings, stabbings, kneecappings, and lots of other messy crimes.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. As the Spider, I&#x2019;d made plenty of bloody messes in my time. It was sort of my specialty.<br> <br>But a few weeks ago, I&#x2019;d taken down Madeline Magda Monroe, an acid elemental who&#x2019;d declared herself the new queen of the Ashland underworld, following in the footsteps of her mother, Mab.<br> <br>Just as I had killed her mother several months earlier, I took out Madeline with my Ice and Stone magic, and with no more Monroes left to grapple for control of the underworld, the other bosses had made me their de facto leader. At least until they started plotting how they could murder me and one of them could seize the throne they all coveted so very much.<br> <br>I almost wished that one of them would succeed in putting me out of my misery.<br> <br>Contrary to popular belief, being the head of the Ashland underworld was not a bed of roses. It wasn&#x2019;t even a bed of thorns. It was just a giant headache&#x2014;like the one throbbing in my temples right now.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d thought I&#x2019;d been a popular target over the summer, but now the bosses sought me out more than ever before. And they actually wanted to talk to me. Incessantly. About business deals and treaties and who was letting their gang members spray-paint rune graffiti in someone else&#x2019;s territory. As if I actually cared about any of those things. But as the big boss, it was apparently my job to listen. At least according to Silvio.<br> <br>Lorelei was the one who&#x2019;d requested this meeting, although she&#x2019;d actually approached Phillip about settling the dispute instead of me. Apparently, Lorelei didn&#x2019;t want to acknowledge my new authority or involve me in her affairs. That, or she just hated me for some reason. Didn&#x2019;t much matter either way, since I cared as little about her as she did about me.<br> <br>But Phillip was my friend, and he&#x2019;d told me about the get-together. So here I was, about to mediate my first big dispute as Gin Blanco, the Spider, new queen of the Ashland underworld. Yeah, me.<br> <br>Still, I would have been perfectly happy to skip the polite nonsense of the meeting and let Dimitri and Luiz duke it out until one of them killed the other, but Silvio had pointed out that if I resolved their feud today, they wouldn&#x2019;t show up at my restaurant, the Pork Pit, tomorrow. Since I didn&#x2019;t want the criminals scaring my customers, I&#x2019;d decided to be a good boss and put in an appearance.<br> <br>Everyone had been sitting at the conference table when I walked on board with Silvio. But at the sight of me, Dimitri and Luiz had shot to their feet and started shouting accusations at each other, as if they thought that I would side with whoever yelled the loudest and the longest.<br> <br>Now Dimitri was cursing at Luiz in Russian, and Luiz was returning the favor in Spanish. Since it didn&#x2019;t look like they were going to stop anytime soon, not even to take a breath, I tuned them out as best I could and stared out over the brass railing.<br> <br>The Aneirin River flowed by the white riverboat, the swift current causing the vessel to sway ever so slightly. The November sun glinted off the surface of the blue-gray water, making it sparkle like a sheet of diamonds, while a faint breeze brought the smell of fish along with it. My nose wrinkled at the wet stench. A few crimson and burnt-orange leaves clung to the trees that lined the far side of the river, although the breeze would soon send them spiraling down to the ground&#x2014;<br> <br>Something flashed in the trees directly across from me.<br> <br>I frowned, leaned to the side, and focused on that spot. Sure enough, a second later, a small gleam of light caught my eye, the sun reflecting off something hidden back in the trees&#x2014;<br> <br>Silvio nudged me with his elbow again, and I realized that Dimitri and Luiz had stopped shouting and were staring at me with expectant faces, their arms crossed over their chests. Behind them, their guards wore similarly hostile expressions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Blanco?&#x201d; Dimitri demanded in a low, gravelly voice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your decision?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Luiz chimed in, his tone much higher. &#x201c;Who gets the laundries?&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked back and forth between the two of them. &#x201c;Um . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Dimitri frowned, and anger sparked in his dark brown eyes. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t even listening to us!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it was kind of hard to follow,&#x201d; I admitted. &#x201c;Especially since I don&#x2019;t speak Russian, and my Spanish is rudimentary, at best.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dimitri threw his hands up in the air and spewed out more Russian words, all of which sounded like curses.<br> <br>Phillip leaned over. &#x201c;I think he just insulted your mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>I groaned, but I held my hands up, trying to placate the mobster. &#x201c;Okay, okay. That&#x2019;s enough. Stop. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dimitri finished his cursing, but he still gave me a disgusted look. &#x201c;I knew this would be a waste of time. I should have just killed Lorelei and taken the laundries. Just like I should have put a bullet in your head the night of Madeline&#x2019;s party and taken control of the underworld myself. Just like I should do right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence descended over the deck, and the only sound was the steady rush of the river flowing by the boat.<br> <br>I laid my hands flat on the table, then slowly got to my feet. The scraping of my chair against the wood was as loud as a machine gun.<br> <br>I stared at Dimitri. &#x201c;That was exactly the wrong thing to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone could hear the chill in my words and see the ice in my wintry-gray eyes.<br> <br>Dimitri swallowed, knowing he&#x2019;d made a mistake, but he wasn&#x2019;t about to back down in front of everyone, so he raised his chin and squared his shoulders. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. There&#x2019;s only one of you. I have three men with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled, but there was no warmth in my expression. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you need guards. I don&#x2019;t. I never have. So if I were you, I&#x2019;d start apologizing to me. Pronto.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dimitri wet his lips. &#x201c;Or else?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. &#x201c;Or else your men will be dragging what&#x2019;s left of you off this boat, and Phillip will be sending me the cleaning bill.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dimitri sucked in a breath, but anger stained his cheeks a bloody red. &#x201c;Nobody threatens me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, sugar,&#x201d; I drawled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a threat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dimitri kept staring at me, his breath puffing out of his open mouth like a bull about to charge. Beside me, Phillip and Silvio got to their feet and moved out of my way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Try to show a little restraint,&#x201d; Silvio whispered as he passed.<br> <br>Restraint wasn&#x2019;t a popular word in my vocabulary, but I nodded, acknowledging his point. If I killed Dimitri and Luiz, it would just convince the other bosses that I wanted them all dead, and they would probably start trying to murder me again. I&#x2019;d fought hard for my relative peace and quiet, and I wasn&#x2019;t going to throw it away on a couple of minor mobsters.<br> <br>Even if I did feel like stabbing both of them. Violently. Viciously. Repeatedly.<br> <br>Phillip and Silvio stepped over to where Lorelei Parker was still sitting at the far end of the table. Lorelei had quit texting and was staring at me, but she remained in her seat, with Jack Corbin standing by her side. The two of them weren&#x2019;t dumb enough to take me on, at least not face-to-face, but the same couldn&#x2019;t be said for the other bosses.<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t brave enough to fight me on his own, so he turned to Luiz. &#x201c;You help me with Blanco, and I&#x2019;ll let you have the coin laundries. All of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Luiz scoffed. &#x201c;I want the laundries and that deli you own on Carver Street.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sighed and nodded.<br> <br>I rolled my eyes. A minute ago, they would have been happy to murder each other, and now they were going to work together to try to kill me. Well, at least Luiz had the good sense to try to squeeze everything he could out of the other gangster. Had to admire him for that. Even if he&#x2019;d picked the wrong side.<br> <br>Dimitri and Luiz shook hands, sealing their hasty deal, and then they both faced me, with their guards standing behind them, cracking their knuckles in anticipation of the beat-down they thought they were going to give me. Fools.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now what are you going to do?&#x201d; Dimitri sneered. &#x201c;Against all of us?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me? I&#x2019;m finally going to have some fun. I certainly deserve it, after listening to you two whine like a couple of kids fighting over the same ice-cream cone.&#x201d;<br> <br>My insult was the last straw. Dimitri&#x2019;s cheeks burned even hotter, and he stabbed his finger at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get her!&#x201d; he roared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kill Blanco!&#x201d; Luiz yelled.<br> <br>The two bosses and their guards surged toward me, with Dimitri leaning over the table and reaching out with his hands, as though he wanted to strangle me to death.<br> <br>I kicked my foot into the table leg, making the whole thing slam forward, right into the Russian&#x2019;s potbelly. He gasped and bent over double, causing his very bad, very obvious, very shaggy black toupee to almost slide off his head.<br> <br>But I was already moving on to the next threat. Since I didn&#x2019;t have any knives, I leaned down, snatched up the chair I&#x2019;d been sitting in, and slammed it into the head of the closest guard. He yelped and staggered away, clasping his hands over his bloody broken nose. He lurched past Silvio, who stuck out his foot and tripped him. The giant&#x2019;s head hit the top part of the railing, and the brass let out a loud, pealing note, ringing like a bell. The giant slumped to the deck unconscious. Ding. Down for the count already.<br> <br>Silvio flashed me a thumbs-up. I grinned back, then turned to fight the next guard.<br> <br>Phillip had made sure that no one boarded the riverboat armed, so I wasn&#x2019;t worried about getting shot. Even if someone had managed to sneak in a gun or a knife, I could always use my Stone magic to harden my skin and protect myself from any bullets or blades.<br> <br>Using the same chair, I took out two more guards, opening up cuts and bruises on their faces, necks, and arms. By the time I got done with those giants, the plastic seat had cracked apart, so I ripped two of the metal legs off the chair and swu...</p><h2>The Sky, The Stars, The Wilderness</h2><p>GQ called the three short novels in this collection &#34;wondrous.&#34; A woman returns to live on her family&#39;s west Texas ranch . . . a man tracks his wife through a winter wilderness . . . an ancient ocean buried in the foothills of the Appalachians becomes a battleground for a young wildcat oilman and his aging mentor. Here is Bass at his magical, passionate, and lyrical best.</p><p><p>RICK BASS&#x2019;s fiction has&nbsp;received O. Henry Awards, numerous Pushcart Prizes, awards from the Texas Institute of Letters, fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation, and his memoir,&nbsp;<i>Why I&nbsp;Came West,</i>&nbsp;was a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award.</p>Two appealing short stories and an exquisite novella from Montana essayist and storyteller Bass (The Book of Yaak, 1996; In the Loyal Mountains, 1995, etc.). The title novella revels in the rugged beauty of bluffs and thickets in Texas hill country, where three generations preserve the family ranch as a haven for wild animals and the wild at heart. The narrator, a middle-aged woman living alone on the ranch with her memories, recalls her formative influences: iron-willed Grandfather, whose battle cry (``the natural history of Texas is still being sacrificed upon the altar of generalization'') was stifled by a stroke, then reemerged when the old man relearned speech using the cadences of birdsong; his Mexican right-hand, Chubb, who was afraid of the dark but a tireless worker and fiercely loyal by day; Father, the county agent, who fought in vain to end overgrazing and protect eagles from his sporting, good-old- boy neighbors; and especially Mother, who died when the narrator was still a girl, but whose limestone-bluff resting place ensured that her presence remained, even as the family dwindled one by one. These ties to the past, binding the mother to the daughter and the daughter to the land, prove more durable than any link with potential mates. In ``The Myths of Bears,'' another Texan, Judith, breaks free of the increasing lunacy of her longtime partner, Trapper, outwitting him and enduring winter in the Alaskan wilderness alone, only to be tripped up later by her concern for him; in ``Where the Sea Used to Be,'' an Alabama man breaks away from his cold-blooded rich boss to show a knack for finding oil from the air that makes him legendary, but also introduces him to a rival passion: Sara. As thoughtful and captivating as his previous work: stories that can only increase Bass's reputation as a writer remarkably able to put people in nature in a way that enhances our understanding of both. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now there was green marshland ahead of him, all round the river&#x2019;s last slow curve. He pushed his way through waist-high grass toward one of the three high places in the marshland, where trees grew. They were islands of trees, never visited; the duck hunters went only to the marsh. He had chosen this place months ago, and now was the day to come back.<br> <br>In a squawking flurry two ducks erupted ahead of him, flying low, but his bow stayed on his back; he would not hunt till later, on the way home. He reached the trees&#x2014;a tangle of pin oak and cherry, sumac and hickory, juniper and birch&#x2014;and threaded his way through the grabbing branches to the two rocks that marked the tree he had chosen. There it still was, beside the rocks, still the proper shape: the small bitternut hickory tree with its twin leading stems growing in a slender V.<br> <br>He gave the tree a respectful greeting, and explained what he was about to do.<br> <br>The woven birch-bark pouch was heavy round his neck. He took out the stone blade, a long, notched rectangle of flint with one edge chipped to a fine sharpness. This blade had belonged to the tomahawk used by his father and his grandfather, until its handle broke; nobody knew where it had come from or when it was made. It was very precious to him.<br> <br>Carefully he fitted the blade into the cleft between the tree&#x2019;s two slim branches, twisting them together above it. Then, with tough strands of deer sinew from his pouch, he bound the joined branches tightly above the stone&#x2014;so tightly that they would grow together as the years went by, enclosing the blade.<br> <br>To make a tomahawk for your son, you needed the stone blade, and the wooden shaft, and time.<br> <br>In my father&#x2019;s day, there was still time.<br> <br>When he&#x2019;d finished his binding, he thanked the small tree, and gave it good wishes to grow straight and strong.<br> <br>Then he went back across the marshland to his canoe. On the way he shot three ducks, for the feast celebrating the arrival of the baby son who had been born early that day.<br> <br>I was that son.

Siringo had settled down to store-keeping in Caldwell, Kansas, when a blind phrenologist, traveling through, took the measure of his "mule head" and told him that he was "cut out" for detective work. Thereupon, Siringo joined the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in 1886. <i>A Cowboy Detective</i> chronicles his twenty-two years as an undercover operative in wilder parts of the West, where he rode with the lawless, using more stratagems and guises than Sherlock Holmes to bring them to justice and escaping violent death more often than Dick Tracy. He survived the labor riots at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in 1892 (his testimony helped convict eighteen union leaders), hounded moonshiners in the Appalachians, and chased Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch. Once described as "a small wiry man, cold and steady as a rock" and "born without fear," Charlie Siringo became a favorite of high-ups in the Pinkerton organization.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Pinkertons, ever sensitive to criticism, went to court to block publication of Siringo's book. Frank Morn, in his introduction to this Bison Books edition, discusses the changes that resulted from two years of litigation. Finally published in 1912 without Pinkerton in the title or the text,<i> A Cowboy Detective</i> has Siringo working for the "Dickensen Detective Agency" and meeting up with the likes of "Tim Corn," whom every western buff will recognize. The deeper truth of Siringo's book remains. As J. Frank Dobie wrote, "His cowboys and gunmen were not of Hollywood and folklore. He was an honest reporter.</p><p>Frank Morn is a professor of criminal justice at Illinois State University and author of <i>The Eye That Never Sleeps: A History of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency</i> (1982).</p><h2>Symphonic Dances from West Side Story: Revised Edition</h2><p>(Boosey &amp; Hawkes Scores/Books).

With one tap of that magical stick against the floor, Mortimer could summon a whole factory of tissues. Which was just what his runny nose needed.</p><p><i>Almost, almost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>He stretched out his arm. His fingers closed around the staff, and his nose twitched. Already, it was too late to summon a box of tissues&#x2014;they&#x2019;d never reach him in time. He banged his staff on the floor just before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah&#x2014;Ah&#x2014;ACHOO!!!!!!!!!&#x201d; Mortimer sneezed. Only instead of snot, chocolate pudding came flying out of his nostrils. It sailed across the room and landed with a<i>splat </i>all over the floor.</p><p>Footsteps clomped up the stairwell to his bedchamber; moments later the door burst open, and his assistant, Estella, blew into the room, waving a piece of parchment in the air. &#x201c;Mortimer de Pomporromp, what in <i>heaven&#x2019;s name </i>is this preposterous memo you just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;</i>WATCH<i>,&#x201d;</i> Mortimer cried, trying to warn her. But it was too late: Estella slipped on the puddle of pudding-snot, flipped backward, and landed flat on her back.</p><p>Mortimer cringed as his assistant lay in the goop. It was sticking to her corkscrew curls, crusting on her brown skin, and was most certainly going to stain her lilac pantsuit.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted a booger bath, thank you,&#x201d; Estella said drily.</p><p>&#x201c;Be thankful I had time to bewitch it!&#x201d;</p><p>Estella glared at him as she wrung out her hair. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m thanking my lucky stars.&#x201d;</p><p>Mortimer turned to look out the window. It was a soggy, stormy day, filled with the crackles of lightning and the rumblings of thunder. Just like the stormy rumblings inside his soul. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t coincidence; he controlled the weather with his magic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but <i>still</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;This crazy memo!&#x201d; Estella said. &#x201c;Are we going to discuss it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Woe is me, I&#x2019;m sick!&#x201d;Mortimer complained. &#x201c;Life is <i>horrible</i>!

Beastly and ghastly and rotten&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop being so dramatic,&#x201d; Estella said, and she whacked him with a pillow. &#x201c;You just have a head cold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;WOE!&#x201d; Mortimer wailed. He thrashed beneath his fuzzy blankets and held on to his stuffed animal for comfort, which&#x2014;despite being filled with cotton&#x2014;was a much better companion than Estella in times of distress. True, Estella was a loyal assistant, but in the twenty years she&#x2019;d been by his side, she remained rather unconcerned with his emotional turmoil.</p><p>&#x201c;All your complaining won&#x2019;t get you out of talking about this.&#x201d; She laid the parchment on his chest.<i>To Estella, please inform my children (Lacey, Tracy, Stacey, Macy, Philip #1, Philip #2, Philip #3, and Bob) that I am stepping down from the post of Prime Wizard, Earl of Pomporromp, Viscount of Netherly.

Then she rested a hand on his own. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t just because you&#x2019;re feeling sick, right? This is something you truly want to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is no snap decision, Estella.&#x201d; He puffed his chest out. &#x201c;Sir Mortimer de Pomporromp, Prime Wizard, Earl of this castle, Viscount of Netherly does not<i>make </i>hasty decisions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you say so,&#x201d; Estella said, unconvinced.</p><p>But it didn&#x2019;t matter what his assistant thought&#x2014;he knewin his bones (his nearly <i>infirm </i>bones) that it was time to have another Wizardmatch. Time to put his grandchildren through the ultimate test. The one winner would take it all: his land, his title, his castle.

Recognized as an influence on musicians like <b>Eric Clapton</b> and the <b>Rolling Stones</b>, Johnson was poisoned by a jealous husband in 1938--at the age of twenty-seven. This untimely death, his supposed bargain with the devil that enabled him to play guitar, and the ferocity and tormented originality of his work have given rise to a legend that has inspired a Hollywood movie and numerous stories. <b>Peter Guralnick's</b> extended essay about the life of the man and the myth, and of the place and time that produced both, illuminates much of the obscurity around Johnson without forfeiting any of the mystery.</p><p>Blues fans have long held up Robert Johnson's small but potent body of work as a slender pillar on which much modern blues and rock rest, and the songs themselves remain astonishing paradigms of the blues' most primordial style, the country blues of the Mississippi Delta. Yet, for decades after his murder in 1938, details of Johnson's life and clues into the genesis of his music consisted of little more than the evocative themes and settings of the songs themselves. <p> This brief but absorbing meditation on Johnson's life and art, originally published in 1989 in anticipation of the first release of his complete recordings, benefits from the detective work of earlier blues scholars, most notably Mack McCormick, who began piercing the veil surrounding Johnson's life in the '60s. By the '80s, reminiscences from the bluesman's contemporaries, more solid evidence of his shadowy lineage, and even the belated discovery of photographs added more dimension to McCormick's "phantom" Johnson. Yet, possibly by his own design, Robert Johnson remained more outline than flesh, still explained more lucidly in the fevered nightmares and earthy imagery of his songs than by the scattered details of his life.</p><p> Guralnick succeeds in conveying the power of Johnson's music and delineating both its origins and, ultimately, singular genius. His debts to delta blues avatars Charley Patton and Tommy Johnson are solidified, yet, more crucially, Guralnick roots Johnson's artistic growth in the specific context of this rural corner of Mississippi, at this particular moment between the world wars. He also frankly addresses the potency of Johnson's myth and an early death that only glorifies the brief, bright arc of his work. No less crucial is Guralnick's ability to convey the dark beauty of the music itself, giving <i>Searching for Robert Johnson</i> a broader sweep as an essential blues primer. <i>--Sam Sutherland</i></p><b>Peter Guralnick</b> is the author of the hugely successful book on Elvis Presley, <i>Last Train to Memphis</i>.

Born and educated in Scotland, she now lives in Suffolk with two lurchers and too many cats. Known originally as a crime writer, her first novel, <b>Hen&#x2019;s Teeth</b><i>, </i>was shortlisted for the Orange Prize. Her subsequent crime novels are <b>Night Mares</b><i>, </i><b>Stronger than Death</b><i>, </i>and<i> </i><b>No Good Deed</b><i>, </i>which was nominated for an Edgar Award for Best<i> </i>Novel.<i> </i>Her two previous novels in the Boudica quartet, <b>Dreaming the Eagle</b><i> </i>and <b>Dreaming the Bull</b><i>,</i> are available in paperback from Dell, and she is currently at work on the fourth and final novel in the Boudica saga.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><i>Chapter One<br></i><br>The water was cold, and made brown by peat and recent rain.<br><br>Breaca of Mona, known to all but her family and closest friends as the Boudica, leader of armies and bringer of victory, knelt alone at the side of a mountain stream and washed her face, hands, and the bleeding wound on her upper arm in the torrent. The water ran briefly pink where she had been. She cupped clean water in both palms, rinsed her mouth and spat out the iron aftertaste of blood.<br><br>A blue roan mare dozed in the shelter of a nearby beech thicket, the end result of a lifetime's breeding and better than anything Rome could offer. She was haltered but not tethered and came to call, her feet bound in soft leather to dampen the sound of her progress. Mounted, Breaca travelled north and a little east, moving up into the mountains, keeping to rocky trails where Coritani trackers, paid by Rome, would be least likely to find signs of her passing.<br><br>If she had scaled the peaks, she could have looked west past further mountains and across the straits to Mona, but she did not. The standard-bearer's warning echoed, disturbingly, with the muted footfalls of her mare and would not be made silent. Y<i>ou will never win, fighting as one against many</i>. Vindex was not the first to have warned her of the dangers and futility of fighting alone, or even the second, but he was the enemy and she did not have to trust his opinion.<br><br>It was harder to ignore the warnings of those who cared for her; the elders and dreamers of Mona, who watched over her children through her long winter absences, and could not tell them where their mother was or if she had died yet, at the hand of a standard-bearer who was not quite as drunk as he might have looked.<br><br>Luain mac Calma, the Elder of Mona, had been first, quietly, to say that the Boudica's life was worth more, and vengeance for one man's life worth less, and he had been followed by a succession of others who claimed to love her and hold her best interests at heart. Only Airmid, dreamer and soul-friend, had always understood why Breaca needed to hunt alone as she did and had never spoken out, openly or in private, against the black feather braided into the Boudica's hair and the winter killings that it foreshadowed.<br><br>Airmid was on Mona and Mona was another world and Breaca chose not to look at it and thereby not to think about it, or its people.<br><br>She passed upwards, and the track became rockier. Grey stone lined either side of the tracks, marbled by swirling lichens. She dismounted after a while and unbound the mare's feet, that they might grip better on the wet stones. The rain became less; it had belonged to the night. Clouds on the eastern horizon parted to show the first knife lines of light. Lacking any binding, the wound in her arm slowly ceased to bleed and ached only a little. The officer whose spear had caught her had kept his weapons scrupulously clean, for which she was grateful.<br><br>Half a day's ride to the south, at the overnight campsite where a standard-bearer, an armourer and two junior officers of the XXth legion had died, a wisp of greased smoke rose at an angle to the sky. Crows roused and called and began to drift towards the scent of burning men.<br>The thick-set, grey-haired man stooped over the neck of his horse with his attention fixed on the trail did not appear to notice either of the two slingstones that cracked on the rocks near his head. His horse, noticing both, shied a little, throwing him off balance, and he clutched ineffectually at the saddle. The care of his gods kept his head from cracking on the stones of the path as he fell and a cushion of heather gave him safe landing but he did not rise afterwards, even as Breaca knelt at his side.<br><br>"Where are you hurt?"<br><br>He flicked dry, cracked lips. "I have the flux. You shouldn't touch me; you'll be tainted."<br><br>"Maybe, but the harm is done now." Breaca pushed her good arm under his shoulders and levered him to his feet. She would have given him water but carried none. In its absence, she used the sick man's horse for support, wedging his shoulder against the saddle. He swayed and made himself stand.<br><br>His accent, his horse and the weave on his tunic were all of the northern Eceni. A mark worked in ink in the skin below his collarbone showed the falcon and running horse linked. Breaca ran her forefinger along from horse to falcon and felt the small nodule of amber buried under the skin beyond the falcon's wingtip that verified the mark's authenticity.<br><br>"Are you from Efn&#x2019;s?" she asked, and when he nodded, "Why were you following me?"<br><br>"I wasn't. The mountains are alive with Romans and I would deliver my message from a living mouth to living ears if the flux does not kill me first. I was trying to reach the forests near the coast to take shelter there before crossing to Mona."<br><br>Breaca shook her head. "You won't reach them in time. The men of the fifth cohort are stationed near the coast. The third cohort lost four men last night: the signal fires have been lit since dawn, waking every other legionary into action; they will have ringed the forests long since. I know of somewhere closer that may be safe if we are permitted to enter. Can you ride another two dozen spear throws?"<br><br>"If there's shelter at the end of it, yes."<br>The cave mouth was a vertical crease in the cliff face set by the gods at such an angle that it was invisible unless approached exactly from the south-east. The hound-sized rock placed by the ancestors to guard the entrance was patched with damp moss and hidden by the grasses that had grown up around it. In years past, it would have been scoured clean when the ancestors were honoured at each old moon and the carved marks swirling on its surface would have been made bold again with red ochre and white lime and ash. In the bleak new world of Roman occupation, those who should have done so were either dead or had taken refuge on Mona and the rock and the cave mouth behind it were blurred with neglect.<br><br>Breaca had only passed the cave once, and that the previous winter, but had seen then what others might not, committing its location to memory without any real intention to use it. She probably would not have attempted it now, had not her need driven her to it; the risks of entering such a place without a dreamer were far greater than the risks of death or capture by Rome.<br><br>Standing alone before the hound stone, Breaca said, "I offer greetings to the oldest and greatest of the ancestor-dreamers. I will clear your dwelling place as I leave, I swear it. For now, the weeds are my protection as they have been yours. Will you permit me to enter and to bring one other with me?"<br><br>A voice beyond the range of hearing said, <i>Who asks</i>?<br><br>"I ask, Breaca nic Graine mac Eburovic, once of the Eceni, once Warrior of Mona, hunting now under the black feather of no-tribe. My mark is the serpent-spear which was yours before me and will be yours again when I have gone."<br><br>The ancestor-dreamer said, <i>So. I endure and you may not. It is good you remember that. Have you come to ask my aid in your vengeance, as you did before</i>?<br><br>"No."<br><br>She was the Boudica, who led thousands into battle, and her palms were sweating. She wiped them on her tunic. It was far easier to face the legions in the rain and the dark armed with nothing more than a knife and a pouch of river pebbles than to speak to an empty cave mouth in daylight. She remembered Airmid, and the fear in her voice when she had last faced the ancestor-dreamer: Airmid, who feared nothing and no one.<br><br>Breaca looked back down the path to where the dying messenger waited out of earshot. He had dismounted when she did and stood leaning against his horse. As she watched, he slid slowly to his knees, and then toppled sideways to lie curled like a child, breathing harshly.<br><br>If she had been alone, she would have taken her chances dodging the legions and stayed out in the open. If she waited, she would be alone before too long, but the dying man was Eceni and from Efn&#x2019;s and he had given his life to bring a message to Mona. She could not with any honour leave him to die on a mountain path within reach of the legions when there was shelter at hand.<br><br>Touching the hound stone as much for courage as for luck, Breaca said, "We are two, one wounded, one assailed by flux. We ask only to enter into your protection, bringing our horses, nothing more. The Romans who seek our lives are close behind; I saw them enter the valley as we climbed the mountain. It is my belief that their trackers will have no knowledge of your dwelling place, and that if they did, the legionaries would not dare to cross the threshold. Even they recognize the sacred when they meet it."<br><br><i>Or if not the sacred, then the simply dangerous</i>. The ancestor's laughter was the slide of a snake over winter leaves, a sound to erase all peace and the hope of peace. <i>They know I will pierce their dreams, waking and sleeping, and they will die as did their governor, slowly and in madness. They may not fear you enough to abandon the land, Breaca once-Eceni, but they fear me enough to make offerings in secret to quell my wrath</i>.<br><br>Breaca had seen the twists of corn and broken wine flasks and, once, the rotting head of a doe as she led the horses up the trail. She had not known them as offerings to the serpent-dreamer and even now could not confirm it. She said nothing. A lifebeat of waiting passed. Then, <i>Yes, you may enter. I, who may yet destroy you, give you leave</i>.<br>The cave was not as fully dark as Breaca had expected.

Roth?s comic genius, his imaginative daring, his courage in exploring uncomfortable truths, and his assault on political, cultural, and sexual orthodoxies have made him one of the essential writers of our time. By special arrangement with the author, The Library of America continues the definitive edition of Roth?s collected works. <br><br> This fifth volume of The Library of America?s definitive edition of Philip Roth?s collected works presents four books that exemplify the description of Roth, proposed by British novelist Anthony Burgess, as a writer ?who never steps twice into the same river.? <i>The Counterlife</i> (1986) is a novel told from conflicting perspectives about people enacting drastic dreams of renewal and escape. <i>The Facts</i> (1988)?the first of the ?Roth Books??is a novelist?s autobiography in which the author presents his own battles defictionalized and unadorned. In the second Roth book, <i>Deception</i> (1990), a married American named Philip, living in London, and the married Englishwoman who is his mistress meet sporadically in a secret trysting place where the woman eloquently reveals herself to her lover as they talk before and after making love. In the third Roth book, <i>Patrimony</i> (1991), the author watches as his 86-year-old father, Herman Roth, battles a fatal brain tumor.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Turned on the appliances, tied a blue work apron on over my clothes, and flipped the sign on the front door over to Open. Then I spent the rest of the morning and on into the afternoon cooking up burgers, baked beans, and the thick, hearty barbecue sandwiches that my gin joint was so famous for. In between filling orders, I chatted with the waitstaff, wiped down tables, and made sure that my customers had everything they needed to enjoy their hot, greasy meals.<br> <br>All the while, though, I kept waiting for someone to try to kill me.<br> <br>Not for the first time today, my gaze swept over the storefront, which featured an assortment of tables and chairs, along with blue and pink vinyl booths. Matching, faded, peeling pig tracks on the floor led to the men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s bathrooms, respectively. A long counter with padded stools ran along the back wall of the restaurant.<br> <br>Since it was after six, the dinner rush was on, and almost every seat was taken. The waitstaff bustled back and forth, taking orders, fetching food, and topping off drinks, and the clink-clank of dishes filled the restaurant, along with the steady scrape-scrape-scrape of forks, knives, and spoons on plates and bowls. Murmurs of more than a dozen different conversations added to the pleasant mix of sounds, while the rich, hearty smells of cumin, black pepper, and other spices tickled my nose.<br> <br>Everything was as it should be, but I still looked at first one diner, then another. A few folks swallowed and quickly glanced away when they realized that I was watching them, not daring to meet my gaze for more than a second. But most were happily focused on their food and their companions and paid me no more attention than they should have. They were just here for the Southern treats the restaurant served up&#x2014;not to try to murder me and cash in on my reputation as the Spider, Ashland&#x2019;s most notorious assassin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gin?&#x201d; A deep male voice cut into my latest examination of the storefront and its occupants.<br> <br>I looked over at the man perched on the stool closest to the cash register. Despite his slightly crooked nose and a scar that cut across his chin, he was ruggedly handsome, with intense violet eyes and black hair shot through with blue highlights. His navy business suit and white shirt highlighted the coiled strength in his chest and shoulders, and I wasn&#x2019;t the only woman who paused to give him an admiring glance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is everything okay?&#x201d; Owen Grayson, my lover, asked.<br> <br>My eyes cut left and right one more time before I answered him. &#x201c;Seems to be. For the moment.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen nodded and went back to his meal, while I grabbed a rag and started wiping down the counter.<br> <br>Actually, so far, the afternoon had passed in a perfectly normal fashion, with the glaring exception that no one had tried to murder me&#x2014;yet.<br> <br>Thinking that I might actually get through the workday unscathed for a change, I let myself relax, at least until the bell over the front door chimed. I glanced over at the entrance, expecting to see some new customers ready, willing, and eager to get their barbecue on.<br> <br>Only this wasn&#x2019;t a customer&#x2014;it was a short, thin man wearing a delivery uniform of black boots and matching coveralls.<br> <br>The guy glanced around the storefront for a minute before his eyes locked on me, and he headed in my direction. I tensed, eyeing the long white box in his hand, and dropped my right arm down behind the counter out of sight. A second later, a knife slid into my hand, one of five weapons that I had hidden on me. This wasn&#x2019;t the first time someone had dressed up like a deliveryman to try to get close to me at the restaurant. The last guy was still in the cooler out back, awaiting the skills of Sophia Deveraux, the head cook at the Pork Pit, who also moonlighted as my own personal body disposer.<br> <br>But the guy stepped right up to the cash register, as though this was a simple delivery.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a package here for Gin Blanco,&#x201d; he said in a bored voice. &#x201c;Is that you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here. Sign this.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shoved an electronic scanner at me. I slid my knife into a slot below the cash register, where it would still be out of sight, and took the device from him. The man waited while I used the attached pen to scrawl something that sort of looked like my signature onto the screen. The second I was done, the guy snatched the scanner away from me and shoved the white box into my hands at the same time.<br> <br>He tipped his head at me. &#x201c;Have a nice day.&#x201d;<br> <br>He started to walk away, but I reached out and latched onto his arm. The guy stopped, looked at me over his shoulder, and frowned, as if I&#x2019;d violated some sort of secret delivery-guy protocol by touching him. Maybe I had.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;You need something else?&#x201d;<br> <br>I carefully set the box down on the counter. The seat next to Owen was empty, so I was able to slide it several precious inches away from us. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s in the box?&#x201d;<br> <br>The guy shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, and I don&#x2019;t care. I just deliver &#x2019;em. I don&#x2019;t look inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>He started to pull away, but I tightened my grip on his arm. &#x201c;You should really tell me what&#x2019;s in the box.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rolled his eyes. &#x201c;And why should I do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So I can be sure that there&#x2019;s nothing . . . nasty inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>Confusion filled his face. &#x201c;Nasty? Why would you think that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I drawled. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you check the name on the delivery order again?&#x201d;<br> <br>He glanced down at his scanner and hit a button on the device. &#x201c;Yeah, it says deliver to Gin Blanco, care of the Pork Pit restaurant, downtown Ashland. So what? Is that supposed to mean something to me&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Comprehension dawned in his eyes as he finally recognized my name and realized who and what I really was. Gin Blanco. Restaurant owner. And, most important, the assassin the Spider.<br> <br>He swallowed, his Adam&#x2019;s apple bobbing up and down in his throat. &#x201c;Look, I don&#x2019;t want any trouble, lady. I&#x2019;m just a delivery guy. I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s in the box, and that info&#x2019;s not on my scanner. I swear.&#x201d;<br> <br>I kept my grip on his arm, staring into his eyes, but I didn&#x2019;t see anything but a burning desire to get away from me as fast as he could. Smart man. Still, I let him sweat a few more seconds before I released his arm. &#x201c;Okay. You can go now.&#x201d;<br> <br>The guy whipped around. He had started to take a step forward when I called out to him again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait. One more thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>He froze. He teetered on his feet, and I could almost see the wheels spinning in his mind as he debated making a break for the door. But he must have realized how foolish that would make him look, because he finally turned and faced me again. I crooked my finger at him. The guy swallowed again, but he eased back over to me, although he made sure to stay out of arm&#x2019;s reach and keep the cash register between us. Very smart man.<br> <br>By this point, my words and actions had attracted the attention of a few of the customers, who stared at me with wide eyes, as if I were going to whip out a knife and slice open the delivery guy right in front of them. Please. I preferred to be a little more discreet about such things, if only to keep up appearances.<br> <br>I stared at the delivery guy for a few more seconds before reaching down and grabbing something just below the cash register. He swallowed a third time, and beads of sweat had formed on his forehead, despite the restaurant&#x2019;s air-conditioning. I raised my hand, and he tensed up more.<br> <br>I reached up and tucked a hundred-dollar bill into the pocket on the front of his coveralls.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a nice day,&#x201d; I said in a sweet voice.<br> <br>The guy stared at me, his mouth gaping open, as if he couldn&#x2019;t believe that I was sending him on his way without so much as a scratch on him. But he quickly got with the program. He nodded at me, his head snapping up and down, as he backed toward the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Y&#x2019;all come back now,&#x201d; I called out. &#x201c;Sometime when you have a chance to sit down and eat. The food here is terrific, in case you hadn&#x2019;t heard.&#x201d;<br> <br>The delivery guy didn&#x2019;t respond, but he kept his eyes on me until his ass hit the doorknob. Then he gulped down a breath, threw the door open, and dashed outside as fast as he could without actually running.<br> <br>Owen raised an eyebrow at me. &#x201c;I think you about gave that poor guy a heart attack.&#x201d;<br> <br>A grin curved my lips. &#x201c;Serves him right for not being able to tell me what was in the package.&#x201d;<br> <br>His gaze flicked to the white box sitting off to the side. &#x201c;You going to open that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;When we&#x2019;re alone. If there is something nasty inside, there&#x2019;s no use letting everyone see it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if it&#x2019;s not something nasty?&#x201d;<br> <br>I snorted. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll be pleasantly surprised. I&#x2019;m not holding my breath about it, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Owen finished his cheeseburger and onion rings and had a piece of cherry pie with vanilla bean ice cream for dessert, while I spent the next hour working. Slicing up more potatoes for the last of the day&#x2019;s French fries. Checking on the pot of Fletcher&#x2019;s secret barbecue sauce that was bubbling away on one of the back burners. Refilling drinks and ringing up orders.<br> <br>I also took the package into the back and placed it in one of the freezers. I didn&#x2019;t know what surprises the box might contain, but I didn&#x2019;t want my staff or customers to get injured by whatever might be lurking inside.<br> <br>Finally, around seven o&#x2019;clock, the last of the customers paid up and left, and I decided to close the restaurant early for the night. I sent Sophia and the waitstaff home, turned off all the appliances, and flipped the sign over to Closed before locking the front door.<br> <br>Now all that was left to do was open the box.<br> <br>I carefully pulled it out of the freezer, took it into the storefront, and put it down on the counter in the same spot as before. I made Owen move to the other side of the restaurant, well out of range of any elemental Fire or other magic that might erupt from it. Then I bent down and peered at the package.<br> <br>A shipping order was taped to the top, with my name and the Pork Pit&#x2019;s address. But there was nothing on the slip of paper to tell me who might have sent the box or where it had come from. All of that information had been left blank, which only made me more suspicious about what might be inside.<br> <br>And the box itself didn&#x2019;t offer any more clues. It was simply a sturdy white box, long, rectangular, and about nine inches wide. No marks, runes, or symbols decorated the surface, not even so much as a manufacturer&#x2019;s stamp to tell me who had made the box. I hesitated, then put my ear down close to the top and listened, in case someone had decided to put a bomb with an old-fashioned clock tick-tick-ticking away inside. Stranger things had happened in my line of work.<br> <br>But no sounds escaped from the container. No smells either, and I didn&#x2019;t sense any elemental magic emanating from it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything?&#x201d; Owen asked from his position by the front door.<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;Nothing so far.&#x201d;<br> <br>The lid of the box had been taped down, so I palmed one of my knives and sliced through the material, careful not to jiggle the package any more than necessary. Then I waited, counting off the seconds in my head. Ten . . . twenty . . . thirty . . . forty-five . . . sixty . . .<br> <br>After two minutes had passed, I was reasonably sure that nothing would happen until I actually opened the box.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here goes nothing,&#x201d; I called out to Owen.<br> <br>I slowly drew the top off the box and reached for my Stone magic, using it to harden my skin, head, hair, eyes, and any other part of me that might get caught in a blast from a bomb or any rune trap that might be hidden inside. A sunburst rune that would make elemental Fire explode in my face, a saw symbol that would send sharp, daggerlike needles of Ice shooting out at me, maybe even some sort of Air elemental cloud design that would suck all of the oxygen away from me and suffocate me on the spot.<br> <br>But none of those things happened, and all I saw was a thick layer of white tissue paper wrapped around whatever was inside.<br> <br>I carefully pushed one side of the paper out of the way, then the other, still holding on to my Stone power to protect myself from any possible problems. But to my surprise, the box held something innocuous after all: flowers.<br> <br>Roses, to be exact&#x2014;black roses.<br> <br>I let go of my magic, my skin reverting back to its normal soft texture, and frowned, wondering who would send me roses. I picked up one of the flowers, mindful of the sharp, curved thorns sticking out from the stem, and turned the blossom around and around, as if it held some sort of clue that would tell me who had sent it and why.<br> <br>And it did.<br> <br>Because this wasn&#x2019;t your typical rose. The stem was a milky white instead of the usual green, while the thorns were the same pale shade. But really, it was the petals that caught my attention, because they weren&#x2019;t black so much as they were a deep, dark, vivid blue, a color that I&#x2019;d only seen one place before.<br> <br>&#x201c;All clear,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Owen stepped over to the counter and looked into the box. &#x201c;Roses? Somebody sent you roses?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It looks that way,&#x201d; I murmured.<br> <br>A white card was lying on top of the flowers, and I picked it up. Only two words were scrawled across the front in black ink and tight, cursive handwriting: Happy anniversary.<br> <br>That was it. That was all the card said, and no other marks, runes, or symbols decorated the stationery.<br> <br>I rubbed my fingers over the card. Not what I had expected it to say. Some sort of death threat would have been far more appropriate. Then again, I hadn&#x2019;t thought that I&#x2019;d get a package like this today either. But most troublesome was the fact that the two simple words gave me no clue to the writer&#x2019;s tone, state of mind, or true meaning. The card, the message, the roses could have been anything from a simple greeting to the most biting sort of sarcasm. If I was betting, though, I&#x2019;d put my money on sarcasm. Or perhaps a warning. Maybe even a promise of payback, retribution, revenge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy anniversary?&#x201d; Owen asked, peering at the card. &#x201c;Anniversary of what?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced to the left at the calendar that I&#x2019;d tacked up on the wall near the cash register. August twenty-fifth. It had happened ten years ago to the day. Funny, but right now, it seemed like ten minutes ago, given how hard my heart was hammering in my chest. I breathed in, trying to calm myself, but the sweet, sickening stench of the flowers rose up to fill my mouth and slither down my throat like perfumed poison. For a moment, I was back there, back with the roses, back in the shadows, beaten and bloody and wondering how I was going to survive what was coming next&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gin? Are you okay?&#x201d; Owen asked. &#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re somewhere far away right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I said in a distracted voice, still seeing things that he couldn&#x2019;t, memories of another time, another place.<br> <br>Another man.<br> <br>Owen reached over and put his hand on top of mine. &#x201c;Do you want to tell me about it?&#x201d; he asked in a soft voice.<br> <br>His touch broke the spell that the roses had cast on me, and I pulled myself o...</p><h2>How Animals Talk: And Other Pleasant Studies of Birds and Beasts</h2><p>The classic and original text that first explored the telepathic methods of communication of wild animals <br> <br>� Based on years of detailed field observations, first published in 1919 <br> <br>� Written by the famous American naturalist who was the first to study telepathy in the wild <br> <br>� Forewords by biologists Rupert Sheldrake, who has spent 15 years researching the unexplained powers of animals, and Marc Bekoff, the editor of the three-volume <i>Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior <br> <br></i>Many sources have commented on the silent communication abilities of pets, but never before and not since the first publication of this book in 1919 has the subject of animal telepathy in the wild been so fully researched. <i>How Animals Talk </i>explores the phenomenon of vocal, silent, and even motionless communication among animals.

Long theorizes that animals are much more intelligent, emotional, and moral than we have traditionally thought and that their ability to sense the presence of other living beings is an innate ability shared by humans as well.

All safe and living in relative comfort due to the foresight of a &#x201c;doomsday prepper&#x201d; named Noah, who thought of everything&#x2014;including the pixelated walls and ceiling of the upper lounge aglow with a virtual meadowscape of billowing grasses and lazy bees beneath an artificial sky.<br> <br>We spent the first four days confined to two of the silo&#x2019;s dorm levels with the rest of the last-minute arrivals, waiting to confirm the rapid tests administered upon our arrival. Mourning the loss of Julie&#x2019;s husband and Lauren&#x2019;s father, Ken, and my sister, Jaclyn&#x2014;Truly&#x2019;s mother. Stiffening at any hint of a cough across the communal bunkroom, fully aware that there is no fleeing whatever we may have brought with us; the silo door is on a time lock, sealed for six months.<br> <br>By which time the grid will be back up and the disease causing fatal madness in its patients should have died out with the flu season . . .<br> <br>Along with most of its victims.<br> <br>Luckily (there&#x2019;s that word again), the tests held true and we emerged from quarantine to find our places in this new community.<br> <br>That was nine days ago. Nine days of meeting and learning about the others, of feeding chickens on the garden level, starting a formal children&#x2019;s school, and assuming new responsibilities on the kitchen, laundry, and cleaning crews.<br> <br>Of speculating about what&#x2019;s happening in the world above as we watch the electric sunset after dinner.<br> <br>That first week I helped the children make calendars to hang by their beds so they could color in a square each night until Open Day&#x2014;which is how I realized the scene in the atrium lounge is always attuned to the same sunny month: June.<br> <br>If we had come here in June, would we be looking out on a snowscape more closely resembling the December weather above?<br> <br>Yesterday was Christmas&#x2014;the first one I&#x2019;ve observed in fifteen years. I caught Julie crying and knew she was thinking of Ken, and wished, for the thousandth time, that Jaclyn was with us as Truly and I decorated a construction-paper Christmas tree.<br> <br>She asks questions at night. About why I took her away from the compound we grew up in. Why her daddy couldn&#x2019;t come. Questions I answer with lies.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>I TAKE A seat on the floor near the end of the L-shaped sofa in the atrium, one of the last to arrive. It&#x2019;s become regular practice for the community to gather on the upper level beneath the pixelated stars after the children are asleep. To sing songs everyone but me knows the words to as Preston, who used to run a bait and tackle shop, plays the guitar.<br> <br>But mostly to share what we know about the disease. To mine hearsay for information in the absence of any real news, which is a scarce commodity.<br> <br>Especially down here.<br> <br>The chatter is lively tonight. I gaze up at the constellations I had no names for (I&#x2019;d been taught it was a sin to see anything in the heavens but God) until the night Chase and I brought a sky map up from the library below and spent an hour lying on the floor, tracing their shapes in the air.<br> <br>I rarely speak at these gatherings. My story of growing up in a religious commune, while apparently fascinating, has little to offer these discussions.<br> <br>Julie, however, is the widow of the former field epidemiologist who caught the disease while traveling with the CDC team that linked its spread to the flu. As such, she&#x2019;s routinely peppered with questions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do they have any idea of the virus&#x2019;s origin?&#x201d; Rima, our resident nurse and one of the first people here, asks. Her adult son, Karam, told me yesterday she used to be a doctor when they lived in Syria. &#x201c;Is it a bird flu, or swine?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Forget the origin,&#x201d; Nelise, a retired rancher who oversees the hydroponic garden with an obsessive fixation that could give even my OCD a run for its money, says. &#x201c;How long till there&#x2019;s a cure?&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;s asked the same question every night since we were cleared to leave quarantine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Too long for anyone sick,&#x201d; Julie says. She&#x2019;s changed in the three weeks since I left her in Naperville. The woman who suffered no idiots is gone. She&#x2019;s thinner, her complexion ashen as the lusterless gray taking over her once-blond roots.<br> <br>But I know there is no cure. That the best anyone can hope for is a vaccine. That the fatal disease eroding the sanity of North America emerged with a caribou carcass from the melting Alaskan permafrost to infect a herd of pigs and mutated when an infected slaughterhouse worker also became ill with the flu.<br> <br>I know this because I carried the index case samples myself to the man who is, at this moment, involved in the creation of a vaccine.<br> <br>Truly&#x2019;s father.<br> <br>&#x201c;Winnie?&#x201d; Piper, our resident fitness instructor, says, startling me. It&#x2019;s what Truly calls me, the name I gave on our arrival&#x2014;the closest I dare get to my real name, which I will never speak again.<br> <br>Piper is the thirty-something wife of Jax Lacey (also known as Jax Daniels for the cases of whiskey he brought with him), who preps meat in the kitchen&#x2014;including a few hundred pounds of frozen game he shot himself. It&#x2019;s apparently delicious, not that I would know; meat wasn&#x2019;t allowed in the compound I grew up in.<br> <br>And these days I&#x2019;m glad to be vegetarian.<br> <br>I glance at Piper and then follow her gaze across the room, where Chase has just emerged from the tunnel connecting the subterranean atrium to the silo itself. The short crop of his hair has grown an inch in the three weeks since we met, and he hasn&#x2019;t shaved for days. I like the rogue scruff even if it does obscure his dimples, but the tight line of his mouth worries me.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did you two meet?&#x201d; Piper asks as I slide over to make room for Chase on the floor.<br> <br>She thinks we&#x2019;re married. That my last name isn&#x2019;t Roth, but Miller.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s a long story.&#x201d;<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t say that it was while fleeing with the stolen index case samples.<br> <br>Or that I&#x2019;m wanted for murder.<br> <br>I wouldn&#x2019;t have even revealed my history with the cult I grew up in except I couldn&#x2019;t risk Truly, whom I took from there just fifteen days ago, contradicting my story. At least the only people who&#x2019;ve seen my picture on the news were those who had generators&#x2014;and then only as long as stations managed to stay on air.<br> <br>For now, I&#x2019;m banking on the hope that by the time the lock opens and we emerge from the earth like fat cicadas, the hunt for me will be forgotten as the fugitive Wynter Roth becomes just one of thousands&#x2014;possibly tens of thousands&#x2014;missing in the aftermath of the disease. We have time to plan the rest.<br> <br>169 days, to be exact.<br> <br>In the meantime, I like to tease Chase that he&#x2019;s stuck with me, which is more fact than joke. But at least he seems okay with that.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d I miss?&#x201d; Chase says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Piper wants to know how we met,&#x201d; I say. I note the way she&#x2019;s looking at him, taking in his fighter&#x2019;s physique and olive skin. The mixture of ethnicities and striking blue eyes that would snag anyone&#x2019;s gaze for a second, appreciative glance.<br> <br>Chase chuckles. &#x201c;The short version is Winnie&#x2019;s car broke down while she was learning to drive&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;After getting kicked out of that cult, right?&#x201d; Piper says.<br> <br>&#x201c;After she had gone to live with Julie&#x2019;s family, yes,&#x201d; Chase says, stretching his legs out before him. &#x201c;So there she was, stranded on the highway without a valid driver&#x2019;s license. In Julie&#x2019;s stolen Lexus.&#x201d;<br> <br>I roll my eyes. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t stolen.&#x201d;<br> <br>It kind of was.<br> <br>He leaves out the fact that it happened the morning after the grid went down as panic dawned with the day. That I barreled my way into his car&#x2014;and his life&#x2014;out of desperation to get the samples to Truly&#x2019;s father at Colorado State.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooh, so you&#x2019;re an outlaw,&#x201d; Piper purrs, glancing at me.<br> <br>More than she knows.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m relieved when Nelise starts back in about the time she caught a cattle thief on his way to the auction house with two of her cows.<br> <br>It always goes like this at night: speculation about the disease, and then stories from before. Some meant to impress. Some to reminisce. Others to entertain.<br> <br>All of them pointless.<br> <br>We will never be those people again. Julie, the Naperville socialite, whose money can&#x2019;t buy her a single meal or gallon of fuel. Chase Miller, the former MMA fighter and marine, unable to combat the killer running rampant within our borders. Lauren, the popular high school junior who may never see her friends alive again.<br> <br>Me, just starting over in the outside world, only to retreat from it more radically than before.<br> <br>Today, a hospice center janitor is our chief engineer. An insurance broker heads up laundry. Julie runs a cleaning crew. Reverend Richel preaches on Sundays and is the only one Nelise trusts near the tomatoes. Chase works maintenance and teaches jujitsu. Delaney, who ran a food bank in South Dakota, plans our menus. And Braden, who flipped burgers at Wendy&#x2019;s, oversees the cooking.<br> <br>I teach, as I did the last five years of my life inside the Enclave, and rotate between kitchen and cleaning shifts. I look after Truly. I am her caretaker now.<br> <br>Micah, the computer programmer whose son, Seth, has become Truly&#x2019;s new best friend, glances at his watch. At the simple gesture, conversations fade to expectant silence.<br> <br>At eleven thirty-five exactly, the scene on the curved wall before us breaks, a shooting star frozen in midflight. And then the night sky vanishes, replaced by lines of static before the screen goes dark. A moment later it glows back to life, pixels reconfiguring into the form of a face.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s larger than life, the top of his head extending onto the curved ceiling. I&#x2019;ve grown fond of the gray whiskers on his dark-skinned cheeks, the gaps between his front teeth. Even the rogue white hairs in his otherwise black brows that I wanted to pluck the first time I met him.<br> <br>They are as endearing to me now as the man himself.<br> <br>Noah.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s a man resolved to save his own soul by saving the lives of others and one of the few people here who knows my real name. This is his ark.<br> <br>But he is not with us. The time lock meant to keep intruders, chemical weapons, or nuclear fallout at bay requires someone from both the inside and outside to set it.<br> <br>Noah sits in an office chair, plaid shirt peeking through the neck of a tan fleece jacket. The clock in the round wooden frame on the wall behind him shows just past five thirty. The usual time he records these briefings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Greetings, Denizens,&#x201d; he says, with the calm assurance that is as much a part of him as the creases around his aging eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Noah!&#x201d; Jax calls as similar greetings echo throughout the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you can hear this, knock twice,&#x201d; Noah says with a grin. Chuckles issue around me. Last night it was &#x201c;If you can see me, blink twice.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a running joke; the atrium is three stories belowground and video communication is strictly one-way. Our messages to the top have consisted of nothing more than a digital &#x201c;all is well&#x201d; and &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; once a week since Day 1.<br> <br>&#x201c;What news we have is sobering,&#x201d; Noah says. &#x201c;Our ham radio operator reports dire circumstances in cities. Shortages of water, sanitary conditions, medicines, food, and fuel have led to more riots, fires, and the kinds of acts good men resort to when desperate. The death toll of those dependent on life-support machines will climb steeply in the days and weeks to come as those devices shut down, I&#x2019;m sorry to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Preston, sitting across from me, rubs his brows as though his head hurts, and Julie sits with a fist to her mouth. I know she&#x2019;s thinking about her grown sons in New Mexico and Ohio. About her mother, already sick by the time she and Lauren fled the city for her house. Who turned them away without opening her door.<br> <br>I think of Kestral, who first told me about this place. Whose return to the religious compound I grew up in must have induced a few coronaries given that our spiritual leader had told everyone she was dead in order to marry my sister. I hope Kestral&#x2019;s safe. That even Ara, my friend and enemy, is, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;The greatest shortage after food, water, and fuel, of course, is reliable information,&#x201d; Noah continues. &#x201c;We are in the Middle Ages once more, operating on hearsay and what radio operators report. What I can tell you is that the attack on the substation in California three weeks ago appears to be the act of terrorists working in conjunction with the cyberassault on the grid in order to prolong the blackout. The consensus is Russia, though there are those celebrating in pockets of the Middle East and Pakistan and groups claiming unlikely credit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about the attack on the CDC?&#x201d; Nelise says.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got to be them,&#x201d; Preston says.<br> <br>&#x201c;How is it possible we&#x2019;ve harbored Russian terrorists in our country and not even&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shh!&#x201d; several others hiss as Noah continues.<br> <br>&#x201c;The president has not been heard from since his radio address last week. Foreign borders remain closed to Americans, and our neighbors to the north and south have sworn to vigorously defend their borders in an effort to stem the tide of Americans attempting to enter Canada and Mexico illegally. They don&#x2019;t want us there, folks.&#x201d; He hesitates a moment, and then says, as though against his better judgment: &#x201c;There are reports that an Alaskan ship full of Americans was deliberately sunk when it wandered into Russian waters.&#x201d;<br> <br>Piper glances from person to person with a wide-eyed stare. Chase sits unmoving on my other side, jaw tight. There was news of a missile strike in Hawaii hours before we entered the silo. But that turned out to be only a rumor.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s talk of aid from our neighbors and allies in the form of food, fuel, generators, relief workers, and engineers. How much and how quickly remain to be seen. I imagine sharing information toward the creation of a vaccine in exchange for help manufacturing it will be a part of that discussion. Our knowledge of the disease will be the best bargaining chip we have,&#x201d; he says, gazing meaningfully at the camera with a slight nod.<br> <br>&#x201c;What knowledge?&#x201d; Nelise says, too loudly. She&#x2019;s unaware that not only does Noah know about the samples being used in the production of a vaccine but two of his c...</p><h2>The Black Arrow (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>From the beloved author of <i>Treasure Island</i></b> <br><br> Originally serialized in a periodical of boys' adventure fiction, <i>The Black Arrow</i> is a swashbuckling portrait of a young man's journey to discover the heroism within himself.

Once our most indispensable companions, horses were for millennia essential in helping build our cities, farms, and industries. But during the twentieth century, in an increasingly mechanized society, they began to disappear from human history. In this esoteric and rich tribute, award-winning historian Ulrich Raulff chronicles the dramatic story of this most spectacular creature, thoroughly examining how they&#x2019;ve been muses and brothers in arms, neglected and sacrificed in war yet memorialized in paintings, sculpture, and novels&#x2015;and ultimately marginalized on racetracks and in pony clubs. Elegiac and absorbing, <em>Farewell to the Horse</em> paints a stunning panorama of a world shaped by hooves, and the imprint left on humankind.</p><p>&#x201c;A beautiful and thoughtful exploration. . . . <em>Farewell to the Horse</em> is a grown-up, but also lyrical and creative, history book, and I very much enjoyed it.&#x201d;&#x2015; James Rebanks, author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Shepherd&#x2019;s Life</em></p> 103 illustrations; 16 pages of color</p><p><p><strong>Ulrich Raulff</strong> is director of the German Literature Archive in Marbach am Neckar.

You never know what might be on the next page or even in the next sentence. . . . Dazzling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gregory Curtis, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>Farewell to the Horse</em>, Ulrich Raulff has composed nothing less than a requiem Mass for this long-suffering, noble creature &#x2015; a complex and lyrical argument that places the horse in a central role in the creation of the modern world. In his excavations of the 150-year period that makes up this long farewell, the author discovered something marvelous: &#x2018;Horses had more meanings than bones.&#x2019;. . . Raulff has given us an eloquent epitaph for the horse&#x2019;s long relevance to our world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Melissa Holbrook Pierson, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Strange and fascinating. . . . A sweeping cultural history, more kaleidoscopic than totale, as bibliographical as it is historical. . . . <em>Farewell to the Horse</em> is a whirlwind that seems capable of drawing into its vortex almost anyone who ever thought of a horse.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Verlyn Klinkenborg, <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A beautiful and thoughtful exploration. . . . It is shocking how recently we relied upon horses, and as this tale is told, shocking how fast we have moved away from our dependent working relationship with them. This fine history book tells the story of that relationship in its final century, and how horses still run through our culture in countless ways, distant echoes of the pact we long had with them.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Rebanks, author of <em>The Shepherd&#x2019;s Life</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As you pick up the reins of this book&#x2015;trying to get a sense of what sort of a ride it is to be&#x2015;it becomes evident within three paragraphs that you have never read a book like it. . . . [Raulff] has an extraordinarily connective mind and it is seldom possible to predict where he is going with it. . . . Beautifully and idiosyncratically illustrated.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Exceptionally thorough. . . . Raulff offers a look at a changing cultural landscape, primarily in western Europe, with the horse as one of the primary casualties of industry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Maggie Reagan, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Get ready for a wild ride! Operatic in scope, quirky in detail, Ulrich Raulff's magnificent book will sweep you off your feet, and carry you through centuries of art and literature, warfare and industry, all to the sound of the hoofbeats that made so much of human history possible. This is an important, passionate, surprising book. It shows just how much of our &#x2018;progress&#x2019; is owed to another species--a species we both revered and cruelly enslaved. Students of history, lovers of horses, and those of us who recognize the crucial role of animals in human history will give this volume a prominent place on the bookshelf, and gratefully consult it again and again.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sy Montgomery, author of <em>The Soul of an Octopus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;To call this history from scientist and journalist Raulff a sprawling work would be an understatement. The author&#x2019;s deep love of and fascination with all things equine is apparent in this beautifully translated deep dive into the history of humankind&#x2019;s relationship to the horse. . . . Beautifully written and undeniably compelling. Anyone with a love of horses will be in paradise reading this reverently catalogued tribute.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jennifer Stout, <em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating canter through the history of horses and their dealings, for better or worse, with humans. . . . A top-notch addition to the library of any cultured equestrian; highly readable from start to finish.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews, starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;For anybody who loves horses Ulrich Raulff&#x2019;s book is an extraordinary and far-reaching examination of the horse in our art, culture and imagination, as well as its pivotal role in war, commerce and peace over so many centuries.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Korda, author of <em>Horse People</em></strong></p><h2>Tres Leches Cupcakes: A Culinary Mystery</h2><p>Sadie Hoffmiller has relocated from Colorado to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and is starting a new job as an informant for the Bureau of Land Management on an archeological site.

He&#x2019;d said it didn&#x2019;t matter, that the lout had deserved what he&#x2019;d gotten.<br><br>A few days later, she&#x2019;d been bombarded with rotten fruit by a couple of teenage boys when she&#x2019;d come out of the grocer&#x2019;s shop. Her defiance had wilted as she swiped at the gooey stuff on her plaid shirt and brushed foul-�smelling muck off her jeans. She was sure if her father could find the culprits, he&#x2019;d wreak havoc again. And end up in jail again.<br><br>There was no help for it. She was going to have to leave Underhill. She&#x2019;d just been waiting for the morning sickness to pass so she could find a job somewhere in Darwin&#x2014;�and for the right moment to tell her father that she was going.<br><br>And then he&#x2019;d made his grand announcement.<br><br>It was impossible to admit that she knew her father didn&#x2019;t want to return to Wyoming, because then she would have to explain how she could possibly know such a thing. She could never tell him that she&#x2019;d seen him cry. Never tell him that she knew he hated his father and had sworn to stay as far away from King Grayhawk&#x2014;�and King&#x2019;s ranch in Wyoming&#x2014;�as possible.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to uproot your life and Nathan&#x2019;s because of me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can leave Underhill on my own.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have my own reasons for returning home,&#x201d; he replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Such as?&#x201d;<br><br>He cocked a brow. &#x201c;My reasons are my business.&#x201d;<br><br>Pippa was pretty sure his only reason for returning to a place he&#x2019;d hoped never to see again was to spare her any more pain. &#x201c;Daddy, please. You don&#x2019;t have to do this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s done. Start packing.&#x201d;<br><br>That conversation had taken place a mere three weeks ago. She and Nathan and their father were now settled in a suite of rooms at her grandfather&#x2019;s ranch in Jackson Hole, where Pippa found herself in a situation that was fraught with every bit as much tension as she&#x2019;d faced back home in Underhill.<br><br>Her father had neglected to mention that the ranch house at Kingdom Come was already occupied by her grandfather and his four youngest daughters. Or that King Grayhawk was the richest man in Wyoming. Or that the ranch house, built more than a hundred and fifty years ago, had been expanded and modernized into a home so fantastic it had been featured in several magazines.<br><br>More to the point, there had been no joyous homecoming, no delighted welcome for the prodigal son. King Grayhawk&#x2019;s four grown daughters had greeted the invaders with silence and glares.<br><br>Her father&#x2019;s half-�sisters, Taylor, Victoria, and Eve, and their half-�sister, Leah, bitterly resented her father for laying claim to a ranch that was still their home. Pippa had been appalled when she learned the terms of the &#x201c;deal&#x201d; her father had made with King. All he had to do was live for one year&#x2014;�three hundred and sixty-�five days&#x2014;�at Kingdom Come, and the ranch was his. Her father hadn&#x2019;t helped matters when he&#x2019;d ordered the four girls to find another place to live before the year was out, telling them bluntly, &#x201c;Once the ranch is mine, you&#x2019;re no longer welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>No wonder King&#x2019;s daughters hated them!<br><br>To say that Pippa felt like an interloper was the understatement of the century. Entering the kitchen for breakfast was like walking into a war zone. The early-�morning nausea&#x2014;�from a pregnancy she was determined to keep a secret for as long as she could&#x2014;�didn&#x2019;t help matters. Pippa had decided that eating late at night, when she was less likely to run into one of them, or be sickened by the sight of food, made a lot more sense.<br><br>Pippa was peering into the open refrigerator, trying to find something on the shelves that looked appetizing, when she heard a chair scrape behind her. She lifted her head over the edge of the door and discovered the twins, Taylor and Victoria, both wearing pajamas and robes, perched on stools at the breakfast bar.<br><br>Her aunts weren&#x2019;t identical twins. Taylor, tall and full-�figured, was take-�your-�breath-�away beautiful. Victoria had the same blond hair and blue eyes, but she was more lithe and merely pretty in comparison with her sister. Right now, both girls had a glint in their sapphire eyes that boded no good for her.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess she thinks she&#x2019;s too good to eat with the rest of us,&#x201d; Victoria said to her sister.<br><br>Pippa ignored her, turning back to look at the leftovers in the refrigerator. But her appetite was gone, and her stomach was churning.<br><br>I will not be sick. I will not give them the satisfaction. And I will not run away. This is my home now, too.<br><br>But Pippa could understand their antagonism. She wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted a bunch of strangers making themselves at home at her family&#x2019;s cattle station in Underhill, either. That is, if she still had a home there. The station had been sold. There was no going back.<br><br>She chose a plastic bowl containing leftover fried chicken, closed the refrigerator door, and turned to confront the two young women, swallowing down the bile spilling into the back of her throat. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t hungry earlier. I am now.&#x201d;<br><br>She set the container on the counter and opened the cupboard, looking for the saltine crackers that usually settled her stomach. They weren&#x2019;t there.<br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re looking for those Australian crackers you brought with you, they&#x2019;re gone,&#x201d; Taylor said. &#x201c;We had tomato soup for lunch today&#x2014;�which you also missed&#x2014;�and ate the last of them.&#x201d;<br><br>Pippa didn&#x2019;t so much mind sharing the last of her Arnott&#x2019;s Salada biscuits&#x2014;�an Australian version of American saltine crackers&#x2014;�but the smug look on Taylor&#x2019;s face, and her vindictive tone of voice, rubbed her the wrong way. She felt her stomach heave and realized she was in no condition to start a fight. She needed a cracker now, or she was going to embarrass herself by throwing up. But the kitchen was huge, and she had no idea where everything was kept.<br><br>&#x201c;Since you&#x2019;ve eaten the last of my crackers,&#x201d; she said, swallowing hard to keep her stomach from losing its contents, &#x201c;perhaps you can tell me where you keep yours.&#x201d;<br><br>Victoria threw out an arm and said, &#x201c;In the cupboard, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Through gritted teeth, Pippa asked, &#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on here?&#x201d;<br><br>Pippa whirled and teetered dizzily, grabbing the counter to steady herself.<br><br>Her father took one look at her, scowled at the two women seated at the bar, and said, &#x201c;I asked a question.&#x201d;<br><br>Pippa didn&#x2019;t want to be the cause of any more dissension between her father and his sisters than already existed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for some saltines,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Victoria was going to point me in the right direction.&#x201d; She met Victoria&#x2019;s gaze with a lifted brow that suggested discretion in this situation was the better part of valor.<br><br>Victoria ignored the suggestion, rising to confront Pippa&#x2019;s father. &#x201c;Well, Matt, it&#x2019;s like this. Taylor and I were wondering why your precious daughter can&#x2019;t be bothered to eat with the rest of us.&#x201d;<br><br>It felt odd to hear her father called by his first name. Unfortunately, the attempt at familiarity did nothing to soften her father&#x2019;s response.<br><br>&#x201c;When or where or how or what my daughter chooses to eat is none of your damned business,&#x201d; he retorted.<br><br>Pippa had one hand over her mouth and the other hand over her unsettled stomach. She wanted to run from the room, but it felt too much like giving up and giving in. She&#x2019;d promised herself she would never let anyone ride roughshod over her again. She had to stand her ground.<br><br>Her father must have divined her problem, because he started opening cupboards and slamming them closed until he found a box of saltines. He yanked it out and pulled it open, tearing into a sleeve of crackers so it spilled across the counter.<br><br>Pippa grabbed for a saltine and began chewing, her back to the two young women, letting the salt and soda crackers do their work. She was focused on keeping her stomach from erupting, but she could hear her father arguing with his sisters.<br><br>&#x201c;As far as I can see, you two have been living high on the hog here with no responsibility for anyone or anything. You&#x2019;re twenty-�eight. You should be out doing something with your lives. On March 31st of next year, Kingdom Come will be mine. Find yourselves another place to live, because I have other plans for this ranch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d; Victoria asked.<br><br>Her father ignored the question. &#x201c;And if I see you bothering Pippa again, you&#x2019;ll find yourselves out in the cold a lot sooner than that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t kick us out!&#x201d; Taylor shot back.<br><br>&#x201c;Watch me.&#x201d;</p><h2>Public Library and Other Stories</h2><p>Why are books so very powerful? What do the books we&#x2019;ve read over our lives&#x2014;our own personal libraries&#x2014;make of us? What does the unraveling of our tradition of public libraries, so hard-won but now in jeopardy, say about us?<br><br> The stories in Ali Smith&#x2019;s new collection are about what we do with books and what they do with us: how they travel with us; how they shock us, change us, challenge us, banish time while making us older, wiser and ageless all at once; how they remind us to pay attention to the world we make.<br><br> Woven between the stories are conversations with writers and readers reflecting on the essential role that libraries have played in their lives. At a time when public libraries around the world face threats of cuts and closures, this collection stands as a work of literary activism&#x2014;and as a wonderful read from one of our finest authors.</p><p>Ali Smith&nbsp;is the author of many works of fiction, including the novel&nbsp;<i>Hotel World, </i>which was short-listed for both the Orange Prize and the Booker Prize and won the Encore Award and the Scottish Arts Council Book of the Year Award, and&nbsp;<i>The Accidental,</i>&nbsp;which won the Whitbread Award and was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize and the Orange Prize. Her most recent novel, <i>How to be both</i>, was a Man Booker Prize finalist and winner of the Bailey Women&#x2019;s Prize, the Goldsmith Prize, the Costa Novel Award, and the Saltire Literary Book of the Year Award. Born in Inverness, Scotland, Smith lives in Cambridge, England.<i>Here&#x2019;s a true story. Simon, my editor, and I had been meeting to talk about how I&#x2019;d put together this book you&#x2019;re reading right now. We set off on a short walk across central London to his office to photocopy some stories I&#x2019;d brought with me. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Just off Covent Garden we saw a building with the word LIBRARY above its doors. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#x2019;t look like a library. It looked like a fancy shop.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What do you think it is? Simon said. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#x2019;s see, I said.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We crossed the road and went in.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside everything was painted black. There was a little vestibule and in it a woman was standing behind a high reception desk. She smiled a hello. Further in, straight ahead of us, I could just glimpse some people sitting at a table and we could hear from behind a thin partition wall the sounds of people drinking and talking.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, we said. Is this a library?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The woman lost her smile. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, she said.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A man came through from behind the partition. Hello, he said. Can I help at all?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We saw the word library, Simon said. Was this a library once? I said. She&#x2019;s a writer, Simon said by way of explaining. He&#x2019;s an editor, I said.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We&#x2019;re a private members club, the man said. We also have a select number of hotel rooms.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I picked up a laminated leaflet from a pile on the desk about some kind of food promotion or taster deal. Simon picked up a card. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you actually got actual books? I said.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We do do some books as a feature. Please help yourself to a card, the man said a bit pointedly since we already had. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Later, when I got home, I unfolded the advert I&#x2019;d taken, which was for a company working with </i>Library<i> to produce three-course meals which allowed diners to </i>relive your favourite musicals (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | Phantom of the Opera | Les Miserables | Matilda)<i>. I typed in the Library website address off the advert. When it came up I noticed for the first time that a central part of the textual design of the use of the word Library was the thin line drawn through the middle of it&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is what was listed next to the photographs of its 5 luxurious, individually designed, air-conditioned rooms with many modern amenities and comfortable beds : </i>� Terrace Bar � 24 Hour Concierge � Ground floor lounge with stage and bar � Massage and Beauty treatment room � Kitchen with Chef&#x2019;s table (April 2015) � Private Dining and boardroom with conferencing � Double mezzanine with bridge � Smoking Terrace � Access to rare Library books.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Simon pocketed the card. I folded the advert about the food promotion into my inside pocket. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks very much, we said. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then we left. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; We crossed the road and stopped on the pavement opposite, where we&#x2019;d first seen the word above the door. We looked back at it. Simon shrugged.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Library, he said. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now we know, I said. </i><br> <i>*&nbsp;</i><br> <i>In the UK over the past few years&#x2014;over the length of time, in fact, that it&#x2019;s taken me to write these stories and edit this book&#x2014;we've been having to fight hard to preserve an onslaught on our public library tradition. A series of politically driven public services cuts all over the country has been shredding away the rich and communal inheritance that this book in your hands&#x2014;I could say any book in anyone's hands&#x2014;celebrates. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>When I published this collection in the UK it became part of a fierce fight, a growing national movement here determined to defend our public libraries. This happens to be a book that celebrates the communal impact on us of books and of reading, their vital importance when it comes to our individual lives and our shared histories<i>&#x2014;</i>personal, cultural, social, local and international. It celebrates the ways our lives have been at least enhanced and at most enabled and transformed by access to public libraries.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Democracy of reading, democracy of space: our public library tradition, wherever we live in the wide world, was incredibly hard won for us by the generations before us and ought to be protected, not just for ourselves but in the name of every generation after us. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Now here's the book, crossing the world like books do, and here's a greeting to the readers of this new North American edition. Hello. This book wishes you well. It wishes you the world. It wishes you somewhere warm, safe, well-lit, thoughtful, free, wide open to everybody, where you'll be surrounded by books and all the different possible ways of reading them. It wishes you fierceness and determination if anyone or anything threatens to take away your open access to place, space, time, thought, knowledge.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>It wishes you libraries&#x2014;endless public libraries.</i></p><h2>Geography of Loss: Embrace What Is, Honor What Was, Love What Will Be</h2><p>This extraordinary book is borne of loss: the loss of love, of certainty and assuredness, of knowing where we are or who we are, of beauty and youth, of health, of life itself, of privacy, and of roles and of knowing.<br><br>When someone or something we love leaves us, we suddenly walk alone into new territory without them. We become strangers in new lands, places where the landscape is unalterably changed, where the center of gravity has somehow faltered and become weak, making us feel as if we might fall off the surface of the earth. Sometimes, that moment of loss defines the rest of our lives, becoming a center to our compass forever. This unique book is a guidebook, an atlas of those experiences of loss and grief, a map for living through and into change and impermanence, to moving on anew. You are the navigator through the three main sections:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Embrace what is:</b> walk into your new landscape<br><b>Honor what was:</b> be grateful for your old landscape<br><b>Love what will be:</b> live into your future landscape<br>Illustrated throughout with art submitted from around the world, this book is an atlas of experience, utilizing map imagery and the richly metaphoric, evocative, and functional language of geography to help you place yourself on your own journey, to find your way through helpful exercises and an empathetic, expert guide.<br>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p><p><b>Patti Digh</b> is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Life is a Verb: 37 days to Wake Up, Be Mindful and Live Intentionally. </i>Based on her popular blog,&nbsp;37days.com, <i>Life is a Verb</i> contains stories Patti was called to share following the death of her stepfather just 37 days after he was diagnosed with cancer.

But when fellow researcher Wayne Ferris breaks her heart by rejecting her, Megan returns to Maine alone.... Then she meets the town's new police chief, Jack Stone -- the man she knew as Wayne Ferris. Instead of the quiet scholar he posed as, he's an aggressive private eye who's willing to fight for what he wants, just like all the overbearing men in her clan. So why is Megan still feeling a dangerous attraction? And though Jack claims he followed her here because he loves her, can she ever trust a man with so many secrets?</p><p>A native of rural central Maine, Janet Chapman (1956&#x2013;2017) lived in a cozy log cabin on a lake with her husband, three cats, and a stay young bull moose. The author of the hugely popular Highlander time-travel series, she also wrote numerous contemporary romances.ϻ�<b></b><p><b> Chapter One </b> </p><p> Megan MacKeage slipped out the front door of her home and strode across the footbridge guarding the entryway. Discovering she no longer was able to button her coat, she pulled it against her rounded belly and headed to the stable. It had been almost two weeks since anyone had last seen Gesader, and Megan didn't buy her sister Winter's explanation that the semiwild panther was merely hiding from the throng of people that had descended on G� Brath eight days ago. </p><p> The social chaos had started with her and her sisters' birthday party four days before Christmas and wouldn't wind down until after the new year. The annual two-week-long celebration had become a tradition since Heather's birth thirty-three years ago -- which had been followed by six more babies over the next ten years, all girls, all born on the winter solstice. As Grace and Greylen MacKeage's seven daughters had grown up and started traveling their own paths, the once-intimate gathering had expanded when the girls returned every December to Pine Creek, several towing husbands and an ever-increasing number of children in their wake. </p><p> Two weeks was too long for Gesader to stay away, Megan fretted as she pushed open the huge stable door, and walked to Goose Down's stall. "Hey, big boy," she crooned, giving the huge draft horse's nose an affectionate pat. "How would you like to help me search for </p><p> Gesader?" </p><p> She lifted Goose's bridle off the peg under his nameplate and opened the stall door. "The snow is only up to your knees and there's no icy crust, so the trek should be easy." She slipped the bit in his mouth and tucked the bridle straps over his ears. "I haven't seen that black devil since before the solstice and I'm worried about him, even if no one else is." She led Goose into the aisle, hooked him in the cross ties, then leaned her forehead against his large, warm cheek. "What if he's hurt?" she whispered. "What if he got tangled up in a coyote trap or gored by a buck he was trying to bring down?" </p><p> Goose's only answer was a long-winded sigh. Megan headed to the tack room and wrestled the heavy saddle from its stand. "You have to help me sneak off without being seen, Goose, because I don't need any more lectures from anyone, telling me what I should and shouldn't be doing." She grunted, pulling the saddle free. "I'm pregnant, not incapacitated." </p><p> "They only lecture because they love ye," a rich-­timbered voice said behind her. </p><p> Megan spun around with a gasp, dropping the saddle. "Kenzie," she sputtered. </p><p> She'd met the imposing highland warrior six days ago at Winter and Matt Gregor's wedding. Kenzie was Matt's long-lost brother, Matt had explained when he'd proudly introduced Kenzie to everyone who had gathered in the high meadow on Bear Mountain for the wedding. Or to be more precise, his <i>thousand-year-old</i> brother. For Matt was also known as C�ram de Gairn, a powerful dr�idh who had traveled a thousand years forward in time to seduce an equally powerful wizard -- who just happened to be Megan's baby sister, Winter -- into helping him right a terrible wrong. </p><p> No one had been surprised by Kenzie's mysterious appearance, considering that Megan's father, Laird Greylen MacKeage, as well as her uncles Morgan and Callum MacKeage and Michael MacBain, were also time travelers. </p><p> Megan's mind reeled at the realization that the magic she had known since birth appeared to be spiraling out of control lately. Or maybe her head was spinning because she'd stopped breathing again -- which seemed to happen whenever she found herself around Kenzie Gregor. </p><p> "A lass in your condition shouldn't be lifting heavy saddles," he said, his golden eyes dark with reproach. He picked up the saddle, set it back on its stand, then turned and walked out of the tack room. "Nor should ye be riding." </p><p> Megan stared at the door he'd disappeared through, taking deep breaths as she counted to ten. But when she heard Goose plodding back to his stall, she lost what was left of her patience. She ran into the aisle, swiped the reins out of Kenzie's hand, and led her horse back to the cross ties. </p><p> "I am quite capable of deciding what I should and shouldn't be doing," she said, striding back to the tack room. </p><p> Kenzie's golden eyes lit with amusement as he arched a brow at her glare. </p><p> "I understand you've barely been in this century a week," she said. "But you'll soon discover that things have changed in a thousand years. Twenty-first-century women -- pregnant or otherwise -- don't want men lecturing them. We can take care of ourselves." </p><p> "Marriage still seems to be the norm, though," he countered. "Which implies it still takes two to raise a bairn." His gaze dropped to her belly, then moved around the barn before returning to her. "Yet I don't see a husband out here helping you." </p><p> Megan's cheeks flushed with heat. No matter how civilized Kenzie looked with his modern clothes, clean-shaven face, and short haircut, he still had the mind-set of an ancient. "I don't care if you're older than time itself; you have no right butting into my business." </p><p> She spun on her heel and led Goose outside to the mounting stairs. But before she could brush the snow off the steps, large hands suddenly lifted her onto Goose's saddleless back. And before she'd finished yelping in surprise, Kenzie had vaulted up behind her. </p><p> "Where are we off to, then?" he asked with a resigned sigh, taking the reins from her hands. </p><p> Megan went perfectly still. "<i>We're</i> not going anywhere. You're going back to the house, and I'm riding up TarStone Mountain to look for my...my cat." </p><p> Ignoring her dismissal, her unasked-for escort reined Goose toward the slopes crowded with skiers enjoying their holiday vacation. </p><p> Having had plenty of experience dealing with ancient-thinking men, Megan realized he wouldn't be ditched easily. So she might as well take advantage of his willingness to help her -- as well as of the heat that radiated from his overlarge body like a blast furnace. And who knew, maybe some of his brother's magic had rubbed off on him, and Kenzie might be able to conjure up Gesader. </p><p> "The other way," she said, reaching in front of his hand to pull on the reins, turning Goose toward the narrow tote road that ran up the forested side of TarStone. "Gesader is likely hiding in the woods. He doesn't much care for crowds." </p><p> Kenzie urged the Percheron onto the unplowed logging road. "Most cats would be snuggled up in front of a fire this time of year, instead of tramping through snow deeper than they are tall." </p><p> "Not Gesader," Megan said, deciding that riding bareback was much more practical than using a saddle. Be­tween Goose's warmth beneath her and Kenzie's heat enveloping her, Megan felt like she was snuggled in front of a fire. Or else her hormones were acting up again. "If you're from tenth-century Scotland, how do you speak English so well?" </p><p> Kenzie reached around her to her open coat collar. "I've been practicing for several years. Ye should button up," he said, trying to fasten the top button. </p><p> She pushed his hand away. "I can't. My belly's getting too big. So you knew for several years that you were coming to this century? Is that what Matt needed Winter's help for? The terrible upset he caused to the continuum that nearly killed all the trees of life -- that was just to bring you here?" </p><p> Kenzie pulled her back against him by wrapping one arm around her expanded waist. "More or less. Gesader is an ancient Gaelic word. Why did ye name your cat Enchanter?" </p><p> Megan made a production of repositioning herself, and leaned forward to take hold of Goose's mane again. Kenzie Gregor was a virtual stranger, yet he was acting as though they'd been best buddies for years. "My sister named him, as he's really her pet. I've only been back in Pine Creek four months. But with Winter spending so much time with Matt this fall, Gesader seemed to prefer my company to hers. And he's not a house cat, he's a panther." </p><p> "Maine has panthers?" Kenzie asked curiously. </p><p> "No. We have lynx and bobcat, and there have been rare sightings of mountain lions, but no panthers." Megan smiled. "Our cousin Robbie MacBain brought Gesader forward in time three years ago as a tiny cub. Robbie's our resident guardian who's in charge of keeping Penda�r in line. Or he was, before Penda�r lost all his magical powers." She shrugged. "Now I suppose Robbie must guard us from Winter and your brother. He's the logger married to Catherine and is baby Angus's father." </p><p> "Aye, I remember. He carried ye upstairs to bed last night when ye fell asleep in your chair." Kenzie chuckled. "And Penda�r is the cranky old priest who's always the first to sit down at the table and the last one to leave, who keeps eyeing me as if he thinks I'm wanting to steal the whiskers right off his face." </p><p> Megan laughed. "That's Penda�r, though everyone calls him Father Daar around the moderns. He was a powerful wizard before he passed on the magic to Winter. He was the one who brought my father and uncles to this century nearly forty years ago. But Daar sort of... </p><p> he often bungled his spells, and he ended up bringing three other MacKeage men here, as well as six MacBain warriors and all their warhorses." </p><p> She turned to look at Kenzie. "The MacKeages and MacBains were at war at the time, but Michael and Papa declared peace years ago. The MacKeages settled here in Pine Creek when they purchased TarStone Mountain. They built G� Brath, got the ski resort up and running, then decided to find wives to rebuild their clan." </p><p> Kenzie shook his head. "But your poor father sired seven daughters instead." </p><p> Megan shot him a scowl and faced forward again. "Another thing you'll discover about the twenty-first century, Mr. Gregor, is that having a bunch of sons is no longer important. Thanks to modern technology, being female is more often a strength than a weakness. Women can do anything men can do." She shot him a smirk over her shoulder.

Open these pages to meet the glorious angels as they were known by the Church's greatest saints and theologians: Origen and Eusebius, and Sts. Basil, Ambrose, Methodius, Gregory of Nyssa, Clement of Alexandria, and John Chrysostom (among others). Soon you, too, will find yourself on familiar terms with the angels, and they'll begin to play in your life the larger role that God intends them to play.</p></p><p>Jean Cardinal Danielou, S.J.

Christmas is nearly here, but tonight&#x2019;s celebration is rather more pagan. There is to be an eclipse of the moon, and coming as it does on the winter solstice when darkness claims its longest reign, even the most devout are unsettled.<br><br>So why not dance and drink and throw our merriment into the dark as a challenge?<br><br>Also, there is a visitor at court. His name is John Dee and he is reputed one of the finest minds of the age. He has come to court in the Duke of Northumberland&#x2019;s company, and William has commanded him to give a private reading of our stars. Only the four of us&#x2014;�for it would not do to let our secrets, past or future, slip into wider circulation.<br><br>Despite the cold, every courtyard at Greenwich was filled and more. No one wanted to miss the rare and possibly apocalyptic sight of the moon vanishing into blackness before their eyes. Minuette had barely room to shiver beneath her fur-�lined cloak, so closely were people packed on this terrace overlooking the Thames.<br><br>She had managed to keep away from the royal party; below her she saw moonlight glinting off Elizabeth&#x2019;s red-�gold hair. William stood near his sister, surrounded as always by men and women. While everyone else&#x2019;s eyes turned to the heavens, Minuette&#x2019;s sought a familiar figure in the flickering torchlight. She rather hoped she did not find Dominic standing near William.<br><br>A whisper ran collectively through the crowd, transmitting itself more to Minuette&#x2019;s body than her ear. She looked up: overhead, the edge of the moon&#x2019;s circle was eaten away. Despite herself, she felt her pulse quicken and wondered what terrible things this might portend.<br><br>More terrible than a star&#x2019;s violent fall? The voice in her head was Dominic&#x2019;s, an echo of his impatient skepticism.<br><br>Minuette fingered the pendant encircling her neck, tracing the shape of the filigreed star, and smiled. This eclipse is no portent of doom, she assured herself, but a sign of great wonder. And that I can believe.<br><br>She watched the blackness bite away at the moon until it was half covered and still moving relentlessly onward. There were murmurs around her, some nervous laughter.<br><br>A hand came from behind, anchoring her waist with a solidness she could feel even through the layers of fur and velvet and linen. And then, after much too long, a second hand followed until she was encircled. Minuette made herself keep her eyes open, made herself stand straight and not lean back into the comforting weight behind her. Or perhaps comforting was not the right word&#x2014;�for her heart quickened and her breath skipped.<br><br>Although she could count on two hands the times Dominic had touched her since the night of her betrothal, her body knew him instantly, as though it had been waiting for this part of her all her life.<br><br>Only in the dark did he dare to touch her, for only in the dark could they remain unseen. No one must know, not yet. Not a single whisper must cross the court while William (openly betrothed to the French king&#x2019;s daughter) threw himself in secret at Minuette&#x2019;s feet, offering his hand, his throne, and his country to her. It would take time for the king&#x2019;s infatuation to die. And, until it did, no one must suspect either William&#x2019;s passion or Dominic&#x2019;s love.<br><br>So Minuette laughed and played and worked and flirted as though everything were normal&#x2014;�as though William had not lost his mind and thought himself in love with her&#x2014;�as though her own heart was not fluttering madly inside a cage, wanting only to wing itself to Dominic&#x2014;�as though she had no secrets and everything was as it had been before. She saw Dominic every day and behaved toward him the same as always: playful and young and oh-�so-�slightly resentful of his lectures.<br><br>And then, like tonight, he would touch her, and she thought she might weep with wanting to turn into him and cling.<br><br>Instead, she kept her eyes open and directed at the sky as the moon&#x2019;s last sliver gave up its fight and slid into nothing.<br><br>Gasps went up from the crowd, and in that covering moment, Minuette felt Dominic&#x2019;s mouth alight softly just below her left ear and linger. She did close her eyes then, and swayed back slightly as his arms tightened around her waist and they both forgot where they were and who, and in a moment she would turn and their lips would meet and she might die if she waited any longer&#x2014;�<br><br>A great cheer exploded around and below them, and Minuette&#x2019;s eyes flew open to see the moon pulling itself away from the darkness. By the tightness of Dominic&#x2019;s grip on her waist, she knew his frustration. But he was&#x2014;�always had been&#x2014;�the disciplined one.<br><br>Within seconds she was standing alone once more, only warm cheeks and quick breathing to betray what no one had seen.<br><br>What no one must ever see.<br><br>Greenwich Palace had always been a dwelling of pleasure and luxury, of laughter and flirtation, of light and merriment. It was situated on the Thames five miles east of London, close enough to the city for easy access yet far enough to be well out of the crowds and squalor and pestilence. The last two King Henrys had expanded the complex, Elizabeth&#x2019;s grandfather facing it in red brick and her father adding a banqueting hall and enormous tiltyard. Her father had been born here, as had Elizabeth herself. A beautiful palace for a beautiful court.<br><br>On this longest night of the year, the palace blazed with candlelight and what heat the fires and braziers failed to provide was made up for by the great press of bodies. Men and women dressed in their finest, drinking and dancing and circling around their king as though he were the center of their world.<br><br>But what happens to that world, Elizabeth wondered, when the center fails to hold?<br><br>Ignoring the chatter of voices directed at her, she watched her younger brother, worried and angry with herself for worrying. When William had returned from France last month with a treaty and a betrothal, he&#x2019;d poured out to his sister his ardent love for Minuette along with his plans to wed her, and ever since Elizabeth had carried a thorn of anxiety that made itself felt at the most inconvenient times. It&#x2019;s not as though he&#x2019;s being indiscreet, she told herself firmly. He&#x2019;s behaving precisely as a young king of eighteen should behave. Dressed in crimson and gold, William flirted with every female in sight (and even a man or two), he drank (but not so heavily as to lose control of his tongue), and he carried on several layers of conversation with the French ambassador at once.<br><br>And he had not been nearer to Minuette than ten feet all evening.<br><br>Elizabeth, being determinedly talked at by a persistent young cleric, swung her gaze to where her chief lady-�in-�waiting held court of her own, surrounded by a gaggle of men, young and old, all clearly besotted by Minuette&#x2019;s honey-�light hair and her graceful height and the appealing knowledge that she was an orphan in the care and keeping of the royal court. With the influence she held in her relationships to Elizabeth and William, Minuette would have drawn an equal crowd even if she had been pockmarked and fat. But the men would not then have been eyeing her with quite the same expression.<br><br>A voice, very near and very familiar, broke her distraction. &#x201c;How long,&#x201d; Robert Dudley said conversationally as he neatly cut out the disappointed and ignored cleric, &#x201c;is your brother going to continue baiting the French ambassador? William has the treaty he wanted&#x2014;�why make the poor man suffer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he can,&#x201d; Elizabeth replied tartly. &#x201c;And you do the same&#x2014;�only with less care. Everyone knows your father continues to grumble about peace with France. How hard it is for him to swallow, a pact with the devil Catholics.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My father has moved on to other concerns. He&#x2019;s not one to fight a losing battle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As fine a commentary on the Dudleys as I&#x2019;ve ever heard.&#x201d;<br><br>Robert raised his eyebrows and lowered his voice that half step that made Elizabeth&#x2019;s blood warm. &#x201c;We choose our battles with care&#x2014;�political, religious . . . personal.&#x201d;<br><br>His voice returned to its normal tones and he changed the subject deftly. &#x201c;Are you looking forward to tonight&#x2019;s audience? I imagine Dr. Dee has found it difficult to read your stars, complex as you are.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave him a withering look. &#x201c;I am exceedingly skeptical, seeing as this Dr. Dee comes from your father&#x2019;s household. No doubt you have whispered to him all the things you most want him to say of me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You wound my integrity,&#x201d; Robert said, hand on heart. But his voice was serious when he went on. &#x201c;John Dee is not the sort of man to be persuaded by anything but his own intellect and the truth of what he sees in the heavens. I promise you, Elizabeth, whatever he tells you tonight will be as near as you will get to hearing God&#x2019;s own words. I only wish I could be there with you.&#x201d;<br><br>An hour later, as Elizabeth and Minuette slipped away from the festivities, she wished Robert were with her as well. She understood the need for privacy&#x2014;�anything that approached foretelling a royal&#x2019;s future was dangerous, and though William had commanded the audience, that didn&#x2019;t mean he wanted everyone at court to hear about it&#x2014;�but it was beginning to wear on her being just the four of them all the time. The &#x201c;Holy Quartet&#x201d; Robert called them, and not entirely in jest. And now that William took every opportunity of quartet-�privacy to fawn over Minuette, Elizabeth&#x2019;s patience grew thinner with each day.<br><br>The two young women wound through increasingly depopulated corridors until they came to one only dimly lit by two smoking torches, its brick walls chilly and bare. There was a single guard wearing the royal badge at a discreet distance from the closed door behind which waited their guest, not near enough to overhear but only to keep the curious away.<br><br>Elizabeth opened the door to the east-�facing room herself, breath quickening with the rare feeling of anticipation. She was not at all certain what was going to happen in the next hour, and she found the sensation unexpectedly delightful.<br><br>The room showed signs of a hasty attempt at comfort, from the deep fireplace blazing with light and warmth to the four cushioned chairs ranged along one side of a waxed wood table. Across the table was a single high-�backed wooden chair; the man in it rose to his feet and bowed deeply. &#x201c;Dr. Dee,&#x201d; Elizabeth said. &#x201c;Welcome to court.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Your Highness.&#x201d; John Dee straightened and Elizabeth took him in. Although she&#x2019;d known he was only a few years older than she, not even thirty yet, in person she was struck by his youth. Considering all Robert had said and all she had read from correspondents in England and abroad, it was something of a surprise that this young man had achieved such scientific and intellectual stature; then again, Dee had been a fellow at her father&#x2019;s Trinity College at the age of nineteen. More recently the King of France had tried to retain him for his court, but John Dee had declined and returned to England after several years on the Continent, lecturing on Euclid and studying with men like Mercator. He had come to the Northumberland household in the service of Robert&#x2019;s father, and all the court was anxious to meet this man who made things fly and read the stars and charted the heavens with surety.<br><br>Elizabeth sat and waved Dr. Dee back to his chair. Minuette sat next to her, uncharacteristically silent. She had been less than enthusiastic about this idea, which surprised Elizabeth. Usually Minuette was the first to embrace the new and entertaining.<br><br>Upon examination, John Dee looked like many a scholar or clerk, with his neatly pointed beard and unostentatious clothing. His eyes were deep and thoughtful and steady and he met her gaze without flinching. She liked those who were not cringingly cowed by her&#x2014;�but best not let him take too many liberties.<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Dee,&#x201d; she said, looking significantly at the leather portfolio that lay between them on the table, &#x201c;you are aware that it is treason to tell a king&#x2019;s future.&#x201d;<br><br>An irrelevant point. It was William who had commanded this private audience, William who had run with the idea of seeing what lay in his stars. Her brother was afraid of nothing, certainly not his future. But casting charts was legally forbidden for royalty, as it might be used as a pretext for rebellion.<br><br>Dr. Dee was no fool to fall into such an easy trap. &#x201c;I do not foretell the future, Your Highness. I interpret the heavens, which is to say, I translate a very little of what God himself has laid in store. And what could God have in store for our good king but glory?&#x201d;<br><br>Would he lie? Elizabeth wondered. She didn&#x2019;t think he was an open fraud&#x2014;�even if Northumberland would fall for that, Robert Dudley certainly wouldn&#x2019;t. But it took subtlety to tell a king what he did not wish to hear without making him angry. How much would Dee avoid saying? Or was William truly charmed, with a lifetime of good fortune inscribed indelibly in the heavens?<br><br>The door was shoved wide and William strode in, a little the better for good cheer, followed by Dominic dressed in all black and looking more than ever like a shadow ready to wrest the monarch from danger at any moment.<br><br>William went straight to Minuette. Bending low over her chair, he kissed her hand in a lingering and proprietary fashion. Just before it would become uncomfortable for the rest of them, he released her and turned to the visitor.<br><br>&#x201c;Dee!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Welcome to court. We are always glad to reward those who are useful to us.&#x201d;<br><br>No one could have missed the subtext, thought Elizabeth. Tell me what I want to hear, and you&#x2019;ll be rewarded.<br><br>Minuette had brightened with the men&#x2019;s entrance. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this thrilling, to discover what our futures hold in store?&#x201d; She smiled at William (who laughed), then at Dominic (who did not). &#x201c;Who is to be first?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>William dropped into the chair next to hers. &#x201c;You, sweetling, if you wish. What better way to begin, then, with the stars of the brightest woman at court?&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth caught the look that John Dee shot at William before dropping his eyes discreetly. Damn, she thought. He may be young, but he is no fool. And that&#x2019;s all we need&#x2014;someone leaking word of how Will behaves with Minuette in private.</p><h2>Roseville in All Its Splendor: with Price Guide</h2><p>Roseville pottery has become a popular antique ware to collect, and with this guide the patterns can be identified, variations seen, and values estimated.

These thirty-two taut poems and poetic sequences, including an oratorio based on Mississippi "barkeep, activist, waiter" Booker Wright that was performed at Carnegie Hall and the vibrant sonnet cycle "De La Soul Is Dead," about the days when hip-hop was growing up ("we were black then, not yet / African American"), remind us that blackness and brownness tell an ongoing story.

Amy Clarke, legal secretary by day and writer by night, gathers inspiration for her books from her vivid dreams, which she considers private. But as she begins writing her newest novel, the dreams begin to change. What was once just between Amy and God is now thrust dramatically into her everyday life. When she finds herself drawn into a major case at the firm, Amy struggles to balance her job, her writing, and her family. Each area of her life presents its own challenges, and Amy&#x2019;s dreams are just vague enough to keep her on edge all the time. While she trusts that her visions are from God, Amy has a difficult time knowing how to reconcile what she sees as truth with her desire to behave appropriately. Any woman facing the demands of work and family will relate to Amy&#x2019;s life. The excitement and vivid spirituality Whitlow generates, however, are what will keep readers turning the pages. --Carolyn Richard</p><h2>Gotham Central Book 3: On the Freak Beat</h2><p>This volume collects two separate cases of the Gotham Special Crimes Unit. Detective Renee Montoya investigates the disappearance of important evidence amid a gang war and travels to Keystone City in an attempt to unveil the truth about Officer Kelly&#39;s strange mutation. Plus, the dead body of Robin, the Boy Wonder is found on the streets. Now the detectives of Gotham Central must try to solve the mystery of his death while dealing with his former associates, Batman and the Teen Titans!</p><p>Gotham Central depicts crime fighting in Gotham City from the standpoint of the police force, relegating Batman and the other costumed heroes and villains to the background. Unsurprisingly, it underperformed the more conventional Batman titles saleswise and lasted only slightly more than three years. In these story arcs, Detective Renee Montoya searches for a missing bullet that will clear her partner in a shooting, and the team investigates the mutation of a fellow officer at the hands of the criminal scientist Doctor Alchemy. Stefano Gaudiano, who replaces original artist Michael Lark late in this volume, admirably continues the atmospheric, muted visual approach that was the series&#x2019; hallmark. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Color Therapy: Healing With Color</h2><p>Colour is a vibration that is constantly affecting us in our daily lives.

Legendary <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i> author Frances Moore Lapp� and organizer-scholar Adam Eichen offer a fresh, surprising response to this core crisis. This intergenerational duo opens with an essential truth: It&#x2019;s not the magnitude of a challenge that crushes the human spirit. It&#x2019;s feeling powerless&#x2014;in this case, fearing that to stand up for democracy is futile. It&#x2019;s not, Lapp� and Eichen argue. With riveting stories and little-known evidence, they demystify how we got here, exposing the well-orchestrated effort that has robbed Americans of their rightful power. But at the heart of this unique book are solutions. Even in this divisive time, Americans are uniting across causes and ideologies to create a &#x201c;canopy of hope&#x201d; the authors call the Democracy Movement. In this invigorating &#x201c;movement of movements,&#x201d; millions of Americans are leaving despair behind as they push for and achieve historic change. The movement and democracy itself are vital to us as citizens and fulfill human needs&#x2014;for power, meaning, and connection&#x2014;essential to our thriving. In this timely and necessary book, Lapp� and Eichen offer proof that courage is contagious in the daring fight for democracy.</p><p><b>Frances Moore Lapp�</b>, author of the multimillion-selling <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i> and seventeen other books, is a recipient of the Right Livelihood Award, the &#x201c;Alternative Nobel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A small number of people in every generation are forerunners, in thought, action, spirit, who swerve past the barriers of greed and power to hold a torch high for the rest of us.

Frances Moore Lapp� and Adam Eichen make clear that building a positive, even joyful pro-democracy movement that restores power to ordinary Americans isn&#x2019;t just possible&#x2014;it&#x2019;s already happening.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Zachary Roth, author of <i>The Great Suppression: Voting Rights, Corporate Cash, and the Conservative Assault on Democracy</i><br><br>&#x201c;Frances Moore Lapp� and Adam Eichen have written a wonderfully sunny book at an exceptionally dark moment in American politics. They tell us, and I think they are right, that we are witnessing the rise of a movement of movements, and that the movement draws on reservoirs of passion and capacity embedded in our very human nature. This movement of movements that we are beginning to call &#x2018;the Resistance&#x2019; may very well save our democracy. So you need to read this book, and join the movement!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Frances Fox Piven<br><br>&#x201c;In this cross-generational effort, Frances Moore Lapp� and Adam Eichen capture and explore something very important about our moment in history. Amid the serious and intrusive challenges to our democracy, there is an energetic movement to tear down barriers, advance full participation, and create a democracy that works for everyone. And that movement is creative, is winning in many places, and is bringing new people into the fold. <i>Daring Democracy</i> is a great and uplifting read, so grab it and enjoy!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Miles Rapoport, Senior Practice Fellow in American Democracy at the Harvard Kennedy School and former president of Common Cause and Demos<br><br>&#x201c;It is time for a daring democracy.

Edited with Hull's husband, David Wojahn, this book contains all the poems Hull published in her lifetime, before her untimely death in 1994.</p><p><i>Collected Poems </i>is the first book in the Graywolf Poetry Re/View Series, which brings essential books of contemporary American poetry back into print.

She was the author of <i>Ghost Money</i>, <i>Star Ledger</i>, and <i>The Only World</i>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Poetry.</p>Lynda Hull in her short life (1954-1994) wrote memorable poems, distinctive for their flamboyant shadows, a created world where pathos always has some swagger of the doomed: a quality that you might call (depending on your decade) Goth, punk, noir or maudit. In an afterword to a new Collected Poems by Hull, David Wojahn speaks of a "combination of elegance and danger, of lyric acuity and peril." In his introduction, Yusef Komunyakaa makes the comparison to "a desperate screech through a jazz musician's trumpet or sax." In a review quoted on the new book, Robert Polito says Hull's work suggests "a fantasy coupling of Elizabeth Bishop and Lou Reed." <p>Hull understood the way our idea of glamour can be informed by the music and manners of our parents' generation. The sounds, sights and paraphernalia of adult life exert an endless allure, the charm of sexuality before it can be quite apprehended:</p><p>THE CHARMED HOUR</p><p>for my mother </p><p>On the radio, gypsy jazz. Django Reinhardt<br>puts a slow fire to Ellington's Solitude <br>while ice cubes pop in your martini. The sting <br>of lime on my palm. By the sink you lean, <br>twisting your rings. Turn to the window. </p><p>In shadow you could be sixteen <br>again, in your mother's kitchen <br>above Cleveland, the cafes of Warsaw still <br>smoky in your mind with talk and cigarettes, <br>English still a raw mystery of verbs. </p><p>Windows brighten across the city at the hour <br>when voices steam from the street <br>like some sadness -- the charmed hour <br>when, smooth as brilliantine, Phil Verona <br>with his Magic Violin slides from the radio. </p><p>Ice-blue in silk, his All-Girl Orchestra sways <br>through the parlor. You let yourself <br>step with them, let a gardenia release <br>its vanilla scent in your hair. <br>Over terraces, you dance above vapor-lights, </p><p>Gold Coast streets where club doors swing<br>like the doors of banks that never fail. <br>In back rooms men and women spend themselves <br>over green baize tables, the ivory poker chips. <br>In their chests wings beat, steady </p><p>as the longing wakened to from every dream <br>of flying. We could shut the door <br>on this vertigo, but Mother when we <br>come to ourselves our feet skim the tiles. <br>Spoons shine on the table, and Mother, </p><p>we're dancing. I'm mouthing the words <br>to a song I never knew, singing when <br>evening arrives and flattens the sky <br>to a last yellow crease of light, <br>thin as a knife, as a wish. </p><p>Yearning of this kind, bathed in atmosphere, expresses an affection toward the past, as well as a distance from it, celebration as well as loss. Reaching back through the maze of generations, as far back as "the cafes of Warsaw," the poet takes as her guide the ephemeral thread of desire, suggested by details such as "ivory poker chips" and "Phil Verona with his Magic Violin." Hull blends the elegiac and the sensuous into a proxy nostalgia so stylized it becomes ironic. The memory of listening to this music with her mother, dancing to it, becomes a valued, even totemic memory of memory. The child is entranced by the music partly because it comes from the mother's life before the child was born. That imagined past, made of family stories and old music, movies and anecdotes becomes a vital focus for the poet's imagination. The poem, alert to its own straining for recall, becomes a poignant way of "mouthing the words/ of a song I never knew." </p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

He later transferred this experience and inspiration to his family&#x2019;s jewelry business, where he became known for his innovative geometric patterns. He also created a wide range of tableware and decorative objects in gold, silver, and pewter, whose bold, industrial looks were uncompromisingly modern, yet always graceful and refined.<br><br> Many drawings and designs are reproduced here for the first time, and original photographs are complemented by a number of new photographs taken especially for the book.

He attended the Philosophical and Theological Seminary at Regensburg and was ordained in 1900. Adam spent the next two years doing parish work. Adam received his doctorate at the University of Munich in 1904. In 1915, he became a professor of theology in Munich. Two years later, he accepted a chair in moral theology at Strasbourg and in 1919 he went to teach dogmatic theology at the University of T�bingen. He retired from that post in 1949. Adam wrote extensively on theology. His books include: Tertullians Concept of the Church, Eucharistic Teaching of St. Augustine, Christ Our Brother, The Son of God, The Spirit of Catholicism, Roots of the Reformation and One And Holy. Adam is best known for his 1924 work, The Spirit of Catholicism. It has been widely translated, and is still in print today. In The Spirit Of Catholicism, Adam communicates with the laity about the Catholic faith and the Churchs role as the keeper of the faith.I guaruntee [this book] will lead you to a deeper understanding of your own faith heritage, if not challenge it. --<i>Marcus Grodi, President, The Coming Home Network</i><br><br>One of the great Catholic theologians of the twentieth century, Karl Adam, shows us the engaging force of history. --<i>Kenneth J.

The river was turned aside, white water foaming in angry impotence around the northern bank of the promontory. Frustrated, the Missouri channeled a swift torrent of brown water and ice around the bar and hurled it venomously into the path of the 212-foot stern-wheeler <i>Rajah.</i></p><p><i>Rajah</i> was firing hard, preparing to skirt the sandbar. Capt. Amos Buell, commanding, anxious to reach the city and unload his two hundred tons of freight and twenty-six passengers.</p><p><i>Rajah</i>&#x2019;s boilers were glowing cherry red, her exhausts hammering, but Buell called for more power to the boat&#x2019;s two engines.</p><p>The river was coming at him fast and furious, challenging the stern-wheeler to reach its goal, no sure thing for a craft that drew just twenty inches and had 80 percent of her ramshackle bulk above the waterline.</p><p>The paddle wheel had been rotating at twenty times a minute. Now the cast-iron-and-wood monster, twenty-five feet wide and eighteen feet in diameter, churned faster, increasing its revolutions to twenty-three a minute. Startled fountains of foam were thrown up as high as the boiler deck as the wheel&#x2019;s paddles dipped into the river 168 times every sixty seconds.</p><p>Captain Buell recklessly hurled his boat against the flood. Huge chunks of ice slammed into <i>Rajah</i>&#x2019;s bow and banged against her iron sides, to be slowly washed astern. Her exhausts, located on the foam-lashed boiler deck, were pounding now, rattling the stabilizing hog chain that ran from the stern to the wheelhouse.</p><p>Time and time again <i>Rajah</i> made a few feet of headway, only to be driven back by the river, the powerful torrent twisting the boat&#x2019;s bow violently toward shore.</p><p>Buell called for more power, but the <i>Rajah</i> had given all she had. There was nothing left to give.</p><p>The boilers would not take a pound more pressure than they were carrying, and the engineer warned that the boat was in danger of being blown apart.</p><p>Buell decided against another attempt to round the sandbar where the river narrowed and thus concentrated its mighty strength. He&#x2019;d smash right through the bar, trusting <i>Rajah</i>&#x2019;s weight and momentum to carry her through.</p><p>The captain reversed engines and <i>Rajah</i> backed up, going with the current, shuddering as huge slabs of ice thudded into her, threatening to buckle her thin plates.</p><p>Standing on the boat&#x2019;s hurricane deck, Buck Fletcher watched all this with interest but little joy. He was familiar with the stately, floating palaces that plied the Mississippi, but this boat was smaller and slower. However, he knew enough of river navigation to piece together Amos Buell&#x2019;s strategy and the thoughts running through the man&#x2019;s head.</p><p>As <i>Rajah</i> continued to reverse, Fletcher guessed that the captain was going to let her pick up speed and meet the sandbar head-on.</p><p>He did not give much for their chances, especially if the boilers burst and blew them all to smithereens.</p><p>But then, a man shackled hand and foot, guarded by a nine-man infantry detail, had little to lose, including his life. He faced twenty years&#x2019; hard labor in the hell of the Wyoming Territorial Prison, and that was just another kind of death, slower certainly, but just as certain.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he going to do, Major?&#x201d;</p><p>Fletcher turned as 2d Lt. Elisha Simpson stepped closer to him, his round, freckled face anxious, revealing the infantry soldier&#x2019;s instinctive distrust of anything that floated on water. The boy was a West Pointer and looked to be about eighteen years old.</p><p>Fletcher&#x2019;s bleak smile lit up his long, lean, and hard face, still brown from the sun and untouched as yet by the gray pallor of prison, his wide, mobile mouth revealing teeth that were very white under a sweeping dragoon mustache.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess the captain is going to climb right over that sandbar ahead,&#x201d; Fletcher said. &#x201c;He knows he can&#x2019;t buck this current and that&#x2019;s the only way he can make Lexington this side of spring.&#x201d;</p><p>Fletcher shook his head. &#x201c;And Lieutenant, don&#x2019;t call me Major. The War Between the States is long over.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Major,&#x201d; Simpson said, only half listening as he studied the ice-studded river beyond the bow of the boat. The boy stood in silence for a few moments, his face screwed up in thought; then he turned his head and called out over his shoulder, &#x201c;Corporal Burke!&#x201d;</p><p>The corporal, a grizzled veteran in his early fifties, stepped smartly beside the young officer and saluted. &#x201c;Yes, sorr.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strike those chains from the major,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If we have to swim for it, I don&#x2019;t want him weighed down by thirty pounds of iron.&#x201d;</p><p>Burke&#x2019;s face was a study in confusion. &#x201c;Sorr,&#x201d; he said, his Irish accent strong, &#x201c;does the lieutenant think that&#x2019;s wise?&#x201d;</p><p>Such was the reputation of Buck Fletcher as a skilled and ruthless gunfighter and convicted murderer that the corporal was completely taken aback, an understandable reaction not unmixed with a certain amount of fear.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Corporal,&#x201d; Simpson said, &#x201c;the lieutenant is sure.&#x201d;</p><p>The officer studied Fletcher closely, taking in the amused blue eyes in the hard hatchet blade of a face. &#x201c;Major, will you give me your word as an officer and a gentlemen you won&#x2019;t try to escape if we have to swim?&#x201d;</p><p>Fletcher smiled again. &#x201c;Lieutenant, if this tub blows up, we&#x2019;ll all be dead and it won&#x2019;t matter a damn whether you have my word or not. If we have to swim, we&#x2019;d last about two minutes in that freezing water, so it won&#x2019;t matter a damn that way either.&#x201d; As he saw doubt cloud the boy&#x2019;s eyes Fletcher&#x2019;s smile widened and he nodded. &#x201c;Sure, Lieutenant, you have my word.&#x201d;</p><p>That was all it took. The young officer didn&#x2019;t question Fletcher any further. This man had once been a major of horse artillery in the army of the United States and he had given his word. That he might be lying did not, for even a single moment, enter into Simpson&#x2019;s thinking.</p><p>&#x201c;Corporal Burke,&#x201d; the lieutenant said, &#x201c;strike those chains.&#x201d;</p><p>Grumbling under his breath, Burke unlocked the padlock that held the chains together, releasing Fletcher&#x2019;s leg irons and then the manacles around his wrists.</p><p>The soldier gathered up the chains and laid them, clanking, on the deck. Burke gave Fletcher a sidelong glance, his black eyes ugly. &#x201c;Sorr, permission to fix bayonets.&#x201d;</p><p>The young officer hesitated for a few moments, then nodded, saying nothing, his cheeks reddening a little as he refused to look Fletcher in the eye. Burke gave the order and the detail fixed twenty-inch-long, spiked bayonets to their newly issued Springfield rifles. The young soldiers stood alert and wary, mindful that they were guarding a dangerous prisoner, a gunfighter who was said to have killed a dozen men in shooting scrapes from Texas to Kansas and beyond. Such men were deadly, certain, and almighty sudden, and there was no taking even the slightest chance with them, especially now that Fletcher&#x2019;s chains had been removed.</p><p>Despite the cold, as he shivered in his prison-issue canvas pants and shirt, Fletcher was amused. He understood how the soldiers felt. Most of them were raw recruits, and he knew he&#x2019;d feel the same way if he were in their shoes.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s slowing,&#x201d; Simpson said, looking back at the paddle wheel.</p><p>&#x201c;Now the captain will order full speed ahead and challenge that sandbar,&#x201d; Fletcher said. He rubbed his wrists where the manacles had chafed them raw, a small motion nevertheless noticed by Simpson, who threw Fletcher an apologetic glance.</p><p>&#x201c;Better brace yourself, Major,&#x201d; the young officer said. &#x201c;When we hit, this boat could come to a mighty quick stop.&#x201d;</p><p>Fletcher grasped the rail in front of him and spread his feet wider.</p><p><i>Rajah</i>&#x2019;s wheel was turning faster now, biting into the muddy water, propelling her forward. Thick black smoke and showers of sparks poured from her twin stacks, and her exhausts were thumping loud again.</p><p>Chunks of ice, some of them as big as river barges, slammed into <i>Rajah</i>&#x2019;s bow and sides, and the little boat shuddered and recoiled under the impact. Up in the wheelhouse Buell blasted the whistle, defying the river to do its worst. The whistle&#x2019;s screams echoed along miles of the winding river valley, penetrating even the dank, crowded back alleys of Lexington. The ship&#x2019;s bell was pealing, adding its incessant clamor to that of the whistle.</p><p>It was said, Simpson yelled to Fletcher over the din, that Buell had melted five hundred silver dollars into the metal from which the bell was cast to improve its tone.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like six hundred to me,&#x201d; Fletcher said, but the lieutenant didn&#x2019;t hear.</p><p><i>Rajah</i> charged ahead, her paddles churning, shouldering aside ice as she rammed through coffee-colored water, the sandbar getting closer with every revolution of the wheel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>* * *</p><p>&#x201c;Life is just one big wheel,&#x201d; Fletcher recalled warden Nathaniel K. Boswell saying to him just before he was taken under escort from the newly opened Wyoming Territorial Prison in Laramie two weeks before. &#x201c;One day you&#x2019;re on top of the world; then the wheel turns and you&#x2019;re at the bottom again. That&#x2019;s where you are, Fletcher, at the bottom, and you can&#x2019;t get any lower.&#x201d;</p><p>The man had not gone into details about why Fletcher had served only a month of his twenty-year sentence before he was dragged from his cell and told he was being taken under army escort to Lexington, there to meet a man he didn&#x2019;t know.</p><p>&#x201c;This man has a proposition for you, Fletcher,&#x201d; Boswell had said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m told there could be a great deal of danger involved, but I think you&#x2019;d be very wise to take it.&#x201d;</p><p>Boswell shrugged, scratched under his beard with the stem of his pipe, then waved an indifferent hand. Apparently bored, he added, &#x201c;Take this man&#x2019;s proposition or stay here and rot with all the rest. The decision is yours, and I don&#x2019;t give a damn one way or the other.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a choice of a sort, but really no choice at all, and Fletcher had jumped at it.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is this man?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d asked. &#x201c;And why in Lexington?&#x201d;</p><p>Again the warden shrugged. &#x201c;I have no idea, but he has considerable power and influence. I know that.&#x201d; Boswell was a former United States deputy marshal and his eyes were cold and unforgiving. &#x201c;If it was up to me, I&#x2019;d pen you up forever, Fletcher, you and all your kind, paid killers and plunderers. But President Grant himself signed the order for your temporary release, and I can&#x2019;t ignore that kind of authority.&#x201d;</p><p>The warden nodded to the guards who flanked Fletcher. &#x201c;Take him out of my sight until his army escort arrives.&#x201d; As Fletcher was shuffling from the man&#x2019;s office, his heavy leg irons clanking, Boswell had called out after him, &#x201c;Do us all a favor, Fletcher. Get yourself killed.&#x201d;</p><p>* * *</p><p>&#x201c;A man could get killed this way, Major,&#x201d; Lieutenant Simpson yelled to Fletcher above the roar of <i>Rajah</i>&#x2019;s engines and her shrieking whistle, bringing him back to the present. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never had much love for boats.&#x201d;</p><p>Fletcher nodded and placed his mouth next to the young officer&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;Best you tell those boys of yours to find something to hold on to,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;When she hits the bar some of those men could end up going over the side.&#x201d;</p><p>Simpson half raised his arm in salute, then realized what he was doing and his face colored again. &#x201c;Corporal Burke!&#x201d; he yelled more loudly than necessary, covering up his mistake. &#x201c;Get the men braced for a collision.&#x201d;</p><p>Thirty seconds later <i>Rajah</i> hit the sandbar hard. She rammed through half the bar&#x2019;s width and came to a jolting stop. Her wheel was still churning, throwing up high fountains of muddy water, black drops spattering Fletcher and the soldiers far forward on the hurricane deck.</p><p>Buell backed his boat off, readying <i>Rajah</i> for another try. It seemed that more ice was banging against her hull, driven by raging, ugly water, and now, adding to everyone&#x2019;s misery, sleet began to fall, driven by a rising wind from the north.</p><p>It had gotten progressively colder since the day began, and as the gray afternoon slowly shaded into night, the temperature plunged, surely ending any hope of residents along both banks of the Missouri that the recent snowmelt portended an extended Indian summer.</p><p><i>Rajah</i> charged the sandbar again, backed off, charged a second time. Then a third, and a fourth.</p><p>Finally, her straining h...</p></p><h2>Let&#39;s Play Two: The Legend of Mr. Cub, the Life of Ernie Banks</h2><p><b>The definitive and revealing biography of Chicago Cubs legend Ernie Banks, one of America's most iconic, beloved, and misunderstood baseball players, by acclaimed journalist Ron Rapoport.</b><b><br></b>Ernie Banks, the first-ballot Hall of Famer and All-Century Team shortstop, played in fourteen All-Star Games, won two MVPs, and twice led the Major Leagues in home runs and runs batted in. He outslugged Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and Mickey Mantle when they were in their prime, but while they made repeated World Series appearances in the 1950s and 60s, Banks spent his entire career with the woebegone Chicago Cubs, who didn't win a pennant in his adult lifetime.<br><br>Today, Banks is remembered best for his signature phrase, "Let's play two," which has entered the American lexicon and exemplifies the enthusiasm that endeared him to fans everywhere. But Banks's public display of good cheer was a mask that hid a deeply conflicted, melancholy, and often quite lonely man. Despite the poverty and racism he endured as a young man, he was among the star players of baseball's early days of integration who were reluctant to speak out about Civil Rights. Being known as one of the greatest players never to reach the World Series also took its toll. At one point, Banks even saw a psychiatrist to see if that would help. It didn't. Yet Banks smiled through it all, enduring the scorn of Cubs manager Leo Durocher as an aging superstar and never uttering a single complaint.<br><br><i>Let's Play Two </i>is based on numerous conversations with Banks and on interviews with more than a hundred of his family members, teammates, friends, and associates as well as oral histories, court records, and thousands of other documents and sources. Together, they explain how Banks was so different from the caricature he created for the public. The book tells of Banks's early life in segregated Dallas, his years in the Negro Leagues, and his difficult life after retirement; and features compelling portraits of Buck O'Neil, Philip K. Wrigley, the Bleacher Bums, the doomed pennant race of 1969, and much more from a long-lost baseball era.</p><p><b>Ron Rapoport</b> was a sports columnist for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times </i>for more than twenty years and also wrote for the <i>Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Daily News</i>, and the Associated Press. He served as the sports commentator for NPR's <i>Weekend Edition</i> for two decades and has written a number of books about sports and entertainment. He lives in Santa Monica, CA."Rapoport has outdone himself, artfully redefining the Banks most of us think we knew."&#x2015;<b><i>Rick Kogan, <i>The Chicago Tribune </i><br></i></b><br><br>"Well told...an extensively researched portrayal of the public figure as well as the lesser-known, private Banks."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Washington Post</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Growing up, every kid I knew wanted to be Ernie Banks, Chicago's 'Mr. Cub.' But there was much more to Ernie than his MVP seasons or his famously sunny outward demeanor. <i>Let's Play Two </i>captures the best of Banks' playing moments, but also delves deeply into a man who did not seem to want you to know more than you could see. Rapoport, a legendary Chicago sportswriter, has written a fascinating, readable, and impeccably researched book about a man who was a Hall of Famer, but also a decided creature of his times."&#x2015;<b><i>Scott Turow</i></b><br><br>"This is a wonderful book worthy of all the energy and vitality Ernie Banks brought to his remarkable career. But it is also a revealing portrait of the often difficult life of a black ballplayer in America and the often lonely man imprisoned and isolated by his exuberant outer image."&#x2015;<b><i>Ken Burns<br></i></b><br><br>"Mr. Rapoport works diligently to penetrate the curtain of enthusiasm in which Banks wrapped himself....

Although his smile was real, so were the scarring experiences he smiled through. He was more complicated and interesting than the human sunbeam he chose to resemble.

Icicles had already formed on many of the trees that lined the street, looking like gnarled, glittering fingers that were crawling all over the bare, skeletal branches. No animals moved or stirred, not so much as an owl sailing into one of the treetops searching for shelter.<br> <br>Down the block, red, green, and white holiday lights flashed on the doors and windows of one of the sprawling mansions set back from the street, and the faint trill of Christmas carols filled the air. A steady stream of people hurried from the mistletoe-festooned front door, down the snowmen-lined driveway, and out to their cars, scrambling into the vehicles and cranking the engines. Someone&#x2019;s dinner party was rapidly winding down, although it was only nine o&#x2019;clock. Everyone wanted to get home and be all safe, warm, and snug in their own beds, dreaming of sugarplums, before the weather got any worse. In ten minutes, they&#x2019;d all be gone, and the street would be quiet and deserted again.<br> <br>Yes, it was the perfect night to kill someone.<br> <br>Too bad my mission was recon only.<br> <br>I slouched down in my seat, staying as much out of view of the passing headlights as possible. But none of the drivers gave my battered old white van a second look, and I doubted that any of them even bothered to glance at the blue lettering on the side that read Cloudburst Falls Catering. Caterers, florists, musicians. Such service vehicles were all too common in Northtown, the part of Ashland where the rich, social, and magical elite lived. If not for the lousy weather, this entire street probably would have been lit up with holiday cheer as people hosted various parties, each one trying to outdo their neighbors with garish light displays.<br> <br>Once the last of the cars cruised by and the final pair of headlights faded away, I straightened up in my seat, picked up my binoculars from my lap, and peered through them at another nearby mansion.<br> <br>A stone wall cordoned this mansion off from the street, featuring a wide iron gate that was closed and locked. Unlike its neighbor, no holiday lights decorated this house, and only a single room on the front was illuminated&#x2014;an office with glass doors that led out to a stone patio. Thin white curtains covered the doors, and every few seconds, the murky shape of a man would appear, moving back and forth, as though he were continuously pacing from one side of his office to the other.<br> <br>I just bet he was pacing. From all the reports I&#x2019;d heard, he&#x2019;d been holed up in his mansion for months now, preparing for his murder trial, which was set to begin after the first of the year. That would be enough to drive anyone stir-crazy.<br> <br>Beside me, a soft creak rang out, followed by a long, loud sigh. Two sounds that I&#x2019;d heard over and over in the last hour I&#x2019;d been parked here.<br> <br>The man in the mansion wasn&#x2019;t the only one going nuts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me again. How did I get stuck hanging out with you tonight?&#x201d; a low voice muttered.<br> <br>I lowered my binoculars and looked over at Phillip Kincaid, who had his arms crossed over his muscled chest and a mulish expression on his handsome face. A long black trench coat covered his body, while a black toboggan was pulled down low on his forehead, hiding his golden hair from sight, except for the low ponytail that stuck out the back. I was dressed in all black as well, from my boots to my jeans to my turtleneck, silverstone vest, and fleece jacket. A black toboggan also topped my head, although I&#x2019;d stuffed all my dark brown hair up underneath the knit hat.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Philly?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t like being my babysitter tonight?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged, not even bothering to deny it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Gin Blanco, the famed assassin turned underworld queen. You don&#x2019;t need babysitting.&#x201d; He shifted in his seat, making it creak again, and shook his head. &#x201c;But Owen insisted on it. . . . The things I do for that man.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phillip was right. As the Spider, I could handle myself in just about any situation. I certainly didn&#x2019;t need him here, but Owen Grayson, Phillip&#x2019;s best friend and my significant other, had wanted it this way. But I hadn&#x2019;t protested too much when Phillip had shown up at the Pork Pit and told me that he wanted to tag along tonight.<br> <br>With the mysterious members of the Circle out there, a little backup might come in handy. Even if said backup was whinier than one would hope.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why couldn&#x2019;t Lane sit out here with you?&#x201d; Phillip asked. &#x201c;Or Jo-Jo or even Sophia for that matter? Why did I get elected to freeze my balls off tonight?&#x201d;<br> <br>Finnegan Lane, my foster brother, was often my partner in crime in all things Spider-related, while Jo-Jo and Sophia Deveraux respectively healed me and cleaned up the blood and bodies I left in my wake.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because Finn is still dealing with the mess that Deirdre Shaw left behind at First Trust bank, and Jo-Jo and Sophia had tickets to The Nutcracker,&#x201d; I said, ticking our friends off on my fingers. &#x201c;And of course, you know that Owen promised Eva that he&#x2019;d help out with that holiday toy drive she&#x2019;s leading over at the community college.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I would have been happy to help Eva with her toy drive,&#x201d; Phillip grumbled. &#x201c;Thrilled. Ecstatic even.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite their roughly ten-year age difference, Phillip was crazy about Eva Grayson, Owen&#x2019;s younger sister, although he was waiting for her to finish college and grow up a bit before pursuing a real relationship with her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything would have been better&#x2014;warmer&#x2014;than this.&#x201d; He popped up the collar of his trench coat so that it would cover more of his neck, then slouched down even farther in his seat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, poor baby. Stuck out here in the cold and dark with me tonight.&#x201d; I clucked my tongue in mock sympathy. &#x201c;And to think that I was just about to offer you some hot chocolate.&#x201d;<br> <br>His blue eyes narrowed with interest. &#x201c;You have hot chocolate? Homemade hot chocolate?&#x201d;<br> <br>I reached down and pulled a large metal thermos out of the black duffel bag sitting between our seats on the van floor. &#x201c;Of course I do. You can&#x2019;t have a stakeout on a cold winter&#x2019;s night without it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grabbed two plastic cups out of the bag and handed them over to Phillip, who held them steady while I poured. The rich, heady aroma of the decadent drink filled the van, cutting through the icy chill that had crept inside the vehicle. I breathed in the fumes as I capped the thermos and put it away. Phillip passed over my cup, and I drew in a couple more deep, steamy breaths before taking a sip. The dark brew coated my tongue with its bittersweet flavor, softened by the vanilla extract and raspberry puree that I&#x2019;d added to the mixture.<br> <br>Phillip cradled his cup like a bum huddled over a trash-can fire. He took a long slurp and sighed again, this time with happiness. &#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s more like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>We both settled back in our seats, watching the mansion and sipping our hot chocolate.<br> <br>The folks who&#x2019;d been hosting the dinner party must have decided to go to bed, since the recorded carols abruptly cut off, and the holiday lights winked out one door, window, and plastic snowman at a time, further blackening the landscape. The icy drizzle picked up as well, turning into more of a steady rain, each drop tinking against the van windshield. It truly was a night fit for neither man nor beast, but these were my favorite kinds of environments as an assassin. The cold, the rain, and the darkness always made it that much easier to get close to your target and then get away after you&#x2019;d put him down. If I&#x2019;d wanted someone dead, I would have waited for a night just like this one to strike.<br> <br>And I was willing to bet that someone might have the same idea about the man in the mansion.<br> <br>Phillip tipped his cup at the shadow still pacing back and forth behind the patio doors. &#x201c;You really think that he knows something about the Circle?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the best lead I have right now&#x2014;and the only person still alive who might know anything about them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Two weeks ago, I&#x2019;d been kidnapped and held hostage by Hugh Tucker, a vampire who claimed that he was part of a secret group that supposedly pulled the strings on the underworld and everything else in Ashland. That had certainly come as news to me, since I was supposedly the head of the underworld these days. But Tucker had claimed that the Circle was an organization of criminals so high-and-mighty that no one could touch them, especially not a lowly assassin like me. The vamp had also said that the Circle monitored everything from behind the scenes&#x2014;and that they could kill me and my friends anytime they wanted to.<br> <br>But the most shocking thing he&#x2019;d revealed was that my mother, Eira Snow, had supposedly been one of them.<br> <br>My mother had been murdered when I was thirteen, a deep loss that I still felt to this day. But I&#x2019;d viewed her like any other kid. She was my mom&#x2014;nothing more, nothing less. I&#x2019;d never really thought about who she was, much less what kind of person. The good things she did, the bad ones, how she felt about all of them. I didn&#x2019;t know any of that. But Tucker had turned my world upside down with his accusations, and I wanted to know if they were true: I had to know if my mother had been the good person I&#x2019;d always assumed she was, or just as rotten, heartless, and depraved as the rest of this shadowy Circle.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, we could just go knock on his door and ask him about all this,&#x201d; Phillip said.<br> <br>I snorted. &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t tell me anything. Nothing I could trust anyway. He hates me too much for that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phillip shifted in his seat again. &#x201c;Well, at least we could get this over with and go home. That would certainly keep my balls from turning into ice cubes&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>A pair of headlights popped up in the van&#x2019;s rearview mirror. I gestured at Phillip, and we both slouched back down in our seats.<br> <br>A black SUV cruised down the street, passing our van. The vehicle stopped at the end of the block and made a right, disappearing from sight. Phillip started to sit back up, but I held out my hand, stopping him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if they come back.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rolled his eyes, but he stayed still. &#x201c;Why would they come back? It&#x2019;s probably just somebody who lives in the neighborhood&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Headlights popped up in the van&#x2019;s rearview mirror again, and that same SUV cruised by our position. This time the vehicle turned left at the end of the block.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;re lost,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All these cookie-cutter Northtown streets and mansions look alike, especially in the dark.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not lost. They&#x2019;re seeing how quiet and deserted the area is for whatever they have in mind. They&#x2019;ll be back. You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br> <br>We sat in the van, watching our mirrors. Sure enough, a minute later, that same SUV cruised by us again. Only this time, the vehicle didn&#x2019;t have its headlights on, or even its parking lights. It whipped a U-turn in the middle of the street, pulled over to the curb, and stopped&#x2014;right in front of the mansion we were watching.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;What do we have here?&#x201d;<br> <br>The doors opened, and two people got out of the front of the SUV, both wearing long black trench coats akin to Phillip&#x2019;s. They were giants, each one roughly seven feet tall with thick shoulders and broad chests; most likely they were the muscle and bodyguards for whoever was in the back of the vehicle.<br> <br>Sure enough, one of the giants opened a rear door, and a shorter, thinner figure emerged, also sporting a black trench coat, along with a black fedora and a matching scarf wrapped around their neck. I peered through my binoculars, but the person&#x2019;s back was to me, so I couldn&#x2019;t see their face, although from the size and gait, I did get the impression that it was a woman.<br> <br>&#x201c;Some late-night visitors here for a hush-hush meeting with our old friend?&#x201d; Phillip mused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br> <br>One of the giants squatted down. At first, I wondered what he was doing, but then the woman in the fedora and scarf ran over to the giant, who hoisted her high up into the air. Ms. Fedora grabbed hold of the top of the iron gate and swung her legs up and over it with all the grace of an Olympic gymnast. Landing deftly on her feet in the driveway on the other side, she straightened up and started striding toward the mansion with deadly purpose.<br> <br>I cursed, realizing that I was about to lose my one and only lead on the Circle. I&#x2019;d considered the possibility that someone might come here to silence him, but part of me hadn&#x2019;t thought that it would actually happen since everything else I&#x2019;d tried to track down the members of the Circle had been a dead end.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a meeting,&#x201d; I growled. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re here to kill him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since Fedora was already past the gate, I didn&#x2019;t have time to ease out of the van, sneak through the shadows, and stab the giants in the back the way I normally would have. So I dropped my binoculars, kicked my door open, barreled out of the vehicle, and ran down the street toward the SUV.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gin! Wait!&#x201d; Phillip shouted, scrambling to get out and follow me.<br> <br>But I needed to get to the man in the mansion before Fedora did, so I tuned him out. The giants whirled around at the sound of Phillip&#x2019;s voice and spotted me racing toward them. They cursed, pulled guns from inside their trench coats, and snapped up the weapons.<br> <br>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!<br> <br>I zigzagged, and the first round of bullets went wide. But when the giants paused to take more careful aim, I reached for my Stone magic and hardened my skin into an impenetrable shell.<br> <br>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!<br> <br>The second round of bullets also went wide. The giants had come prepared, and the silencers on the ends of their weapons muffled the sounds of the shots. No lights snapped on inside the neighboring mansions. They wanted to keep this quiet? Well, so did I.<br> <br>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!<br> <br>Two of the shots went wide again, but the third punched into my right shoulder, spinning me around. Still, thanks to my magic, it didn&#x2019;t blast through me the way it otherwise would have. I skidded on the ice coating the street, but I managed to regain my balance and charge forward again.<br> <br>Instead of heading toward the giants, I ran straight at the SUV. When I was in range, I leaped up onto the bumper, then the hood, then scrambled up onto the roof. Before the giants realized what I was doing, I raced forward and leaped off the vehicle&#x2019;s roof, pushing off hard and trying to get as high in the air as possible. Lucky for me, they&#x2019;d parked close to the curb and the narrow sidewalk. A second later, my hands hit the top of the wall that fronted the mansion, and I dug my boots into the slick stones so that I could pull myself up onto the ledge. Fedora wasn&#x2019;t the only one who could do gymnastics.<br> <br>I rolled off the top of the wall and dropped ten feet down to the other side, landing in a crouch. I palmed one of the silverstone knives tucked up my sleeves, surged to my feet, and darted forward across the lawn. The ice-crusted grass crunched like brittle bones under my boots.<br> <br>The light spilling out from the office perfectly illuminated Fedora, who was fifty feet ahead of me and moving fast, her breath streaming out behind her in a trail of frosty vapor. She must have heard the disturbance out ...</p><h2>Suspect Relations: Sex, Race, and Resistance in Colonial North Carolina</h2><p><p>Over the course of the eighteenth century, race came to seem as corporeal as sex. Kirsten Fischer has mined unpublished court records and travel literature from colonial North Carolina to reveal how early notions of racial difference were shaped by illicit sexual relationships and the sanctions imposed on those who conducted them. Fischer shows how the personal&#x2015;and yet often very public&#x2015;sexual lives of Native American, African American, and European American women and men contributed to the new racial order in this developing slave society. Liaisons between European men and native women, among white and black servants, and between servants and masters, as well as sexual slander among whites and acts of sexualized violence against slaves, were debated, denied, and recorded in the courtrooms of colonial North Carolina. Indentured servants, slaves, Cherokee and Catawba women, and other members of less privileged groups sometimes resisted colonial norms, making sexual choices that irritated neighbors, juries, and magistrates and resulted in legal penalties and other acts of retribution. The sexual practices of ordinary people vividly bring to light the little-known but significant ways in which notions of racial difference were alternately contested and affirmed before the American Revolution.Fischer makes an innovative contribution to the history of race, class, and gender in early America by uncovering a detailed record of illicit sexual exchanges in colonial North Carolina and showing how acts of resistance to sexual rules complicated ideas about inherent racial difference.</p></p><p>&#34;Suspect Relations is an important contribution to the contemporary discussion of the origins of race as a category, an assumed &#39;physical fact,&#39; in the American colonies.&#34; Karen Ordahl KuppermanKirsten Fischer is Associate Professor of History at the University of Minnesota.</p><h2>The Rough Patch: Marriage and the Art of Living Together</h2><p>From a leading clinical psychologist who has counseled couples and individuals for decades, a wise, radical, and optimistic approach to marriage that promises compatibility between an individual&#x2019;s development and the often relentless demands of a relationship.<br><br>People today are trying to make their marriages work over longer lives than ever before&#x2014;for their children&#x2019;s health and well-being, and for their own.

You have been married twelve years. You didn&#x2019;t marry too young. You had your adventures and your choices. You now have two little girls (ten and seven), or two little boys, or one of each. You were in love when you married. That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ve always believed, at least, although now sometimes you wonder. You knew you were different from each other, but at the beginning that was fine&#x2014;it helped you feel stable, or it helped you grow, and it was even exciting, as you noticed how much you wanted to reach out and understand and even indulge each other&#x2019;s differences. Yet now you feel too different. Sometimes you drive each other crazy. Or leave each other feeling deeply hurt. Or kind of neutral. Or each of these, at different times.<br> <br>A lot of advice is out there to help you deal with the problem. Social scientists tell you that people are happier at sixty-five than forty-five, so if you wait it out another twenty years, you might feel better. The couple specialists, the work-family balance people, the sex and intimacy experts, all have something to say that almost fits. But somehow they don&#x2019;t get at the crux of the problem. The crux is that you feel lost, or lonely, or at times almost blindingly miserable. Sometimes you feel you can&#x2019;t breathe. It&#x2019;s true that you&#x2019;re exhausted at work, or your mother&#x2019;s ill, or your hormones are out of whack. But it&#x2019;s hard to believe that that&#x2019;s the whole story. You didn&#x2019;t always feel this stuck in your relationship. There was a time when the marriage made sense.<br> <br>What changed? And why? Perhaps you felt fine about your marriage, until you surprised yourself by becoming infatuated with someone else. Or maybe you were absorbed by the care of your kids when they were small and didn&#x2019;t give much thought to your personal satisfaction. But now your older daughter/son spends time texting her/his friends (how did that happen so quickly?) and doesn&#x2019;t seem interested in being around you on the weekends. Even if the child-centered marriage didn&#x2019;t foster much passion, at least it provided a meaningful framework. Now things are shifting. What felt tolerable before doesn&#x2019;t anymore. You are left wondering, where am I in all this? Who have I become?<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not quite fair, but you can&#x2019;t help blaming your partner for how dissatisfied you sometimes feel. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine putting up with her/his workaholism/drama/withdrawal/insensitivity for another few decades. Yet you know feeling this way is wrong somehow. Marriage takes work. Immature people think relationships should be easy or fun; selfish people leave when the going gets rough. You&#x2019;ve always been a good worker; you&#x2019;re great at work. But it&#x2019;s not clear what you are working for. Deep down, you aren&#x2019;t sure things can change. And the truth (shameful and hard to utter) is that sometimes you feel you&#x2019;re not sure you want things to change anymore. You don&#x2019;t want to have to work so hard for whatever incremental satisfactions you might gain. Occasionally you feel a whiff of freedom, and it is shockingly exhilarating. You feel guilty about it, but on the other hand, you are still youngish. You deserve to have some intimacy and passion and real connection in your life. You won&#x2019;t have your energy or looks forever. How long is it reasonable to go on like this?<br> <br>But you don&#x2019;t want to make any destructive decisions. That&#x2019;s the path your sister/uncle/best friend took, and look where it left them. The kids, let&#x2019;s face it, suffered. Shuttling back and forth between houses, forced to witness their parents&#x2019; heartaches at way too close a range, and no money saved for college. And the adults imported their same old problems into the next relationship. Lately, though, you find yourself calling to mind the success stories: the kids who seem to have emerged unscathed, and the parents who seem so much happier, like new people. Still, you don&#x2019;t want to divorce. It would be easier, better, if you could find a way not to be so unhappy in your marriage. Or maybe not to be so unhappy, period.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>THE ROUGH PATCH. &#x201c;Lonely.&#x201d; &#x201c;Confused.&#x201d; &#x201c;Stuck.&#x201d; &#x201c;Stirred up.&#x201d; &#x201c;Going through the motions.&#x201d; &#x201c;Falling apart.&#x201d; I see a hitting-the-wall unhappiness in the middle slice of life, when people struggle, alone or in pairs, to figure out why their marriages don&#x2019;t feel right. In my work as a therapist, I am reminded every day of people&#x2019;s conundrums:<br> <br>� Is my problem that I need to find a way to resuscitate some loving feeling toward my partner? Or is it my own harsh insistence that I shouldn&#x2019;t give up?<br> <br>� I know I should think about my predicament, but I&#x2019;m so sick of thinking. I just want to feel for a change.<br> <br>� I know my infatuation with my coworker is a &#x201c;fantasy,&#x201d; but why does it feel like the most real thing in my life?<br> <br>� Reminding myself how grateful I should be for what I have just makes me feel worse.<br> <br>� Can I, or should I, spend the rest of my life with minimal affection or sex?<br> <br>� Can I, or should I, keep living with my partner&#x2019;s substance use/spending habit/mental illness?<br> <br>� My partner is withdrawing from me but I don&#x2019;t know if I can, or want to, change in the ways (s)he wants me to.<br> <br>� If my greatest goal is to give my children a happy childhood, how can I do that if I am unhappy in my marriage? Yet what if trying to find more happiness for myself comes at the expense of theirs?<br> <br>People who seek my help often feel they are caught between what they should do and what they feel. When I spoke with Lisa, a professional, she had just turned forty-seven, and she struggled with the sound of it. &#x201c;I never felt middle-aged. Then I turned forty-seven. It&#x2019;s a number that sticks in my mind. Forty-seven is a big deal. Fifty is a big deal.&#x201d; Why? &#x201c;I feel like I should have figured it out by fifty.&#x201d; She hadn&#x2019;t figured it out; she felt more confused than ever. Feeling exhausted from work, parenthood, and family life, and alienated from her husband of fifteen years, she found herself acting entirely against her values, embarking on an affair with a younger man. &#x201c;I was shocked to be with someone I was excited about&#x2014;texting and calling someone I can communicate with, without the burden of all the family stuff. My physical relationship with my husband is dismal, and I sort of chalked it up to the inevitable effect of aging. What&#x2019;s funny is this guy reminds me of my husband&#x2014;smart, professional&#x2014;but ten years younger. Now I&#x2019;ve really become a middle-aged clich�: almost fifty, in a rut in my marriage, finding someone young and exciting . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I am struck by how often people try to dismiss their marital distress as &#x201c;clich�,&#x201d; embarrassed to have fallen prey to the &#x201c;midlife crisis,&#x201d; a construct toward which they felt, until recently, comfortably disparaging. We&#x2019;re voyeuristically critical toward middle-age flameouts&#x2014;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s divorcing him and marrying their tenant!&#x201d; &#x201c;He ran off with a lap dancer and now he&#x2019;s bringing her to the kids&#x2019; soccer games!&#x201d;&#x2014;partly to protect ourselves. We feel vulnerable to life&#x2019;s surprises and attempt to fortify ourselves through the communal conviction that people should be more grown-up. Finding ourselves susceptible to feelings that we so recently judged as selfish or immature in others is a rude awakening, especially destabilizing when we felt, not so long ago, pretty confident and successful about our choices.<br> <br>But humbled as we are by our lack of originality, we may privately feel something momentous is happening. We feel we are waking out of a stupor, and that we can&#x2019;t bear to go back and re-anesthetize ourselves. Perhaps we had a strange sort of relief in plunging into the childrearing years, when our own desires were back-burnered. Serving our children&#x2019;s needs allowed us to take a break from wanting things for ourselves, and all the complicated dilemmas it engendered. But somewhere inside we knew this wasn&#x2019;t a tenable long-term solution. Kids grow up. Statistically, we may be looking at another forty years of life. Unlike in the 1950s, it&#x2019;s no longer realistic to wait for our two-pack-a-day habit to kill us at sixty-two. It&#x2019;s obvious we can&#x2019;t keep swallowing the vague adage that &#x201c;marriage is compromise,&#x201d; if compromise means suppressing whole swaths of our personalities. Life is too long, and too short. We have to find some way to stay vital, engaged, desiring, and ourselves while being married, if married is what we want to be.<br> <br>When we trivialize the rough patch as a &#x201c;middle-aged clich�,&#x201d; we are actually trying to find a way to disarm the intensity of the forces we are grappling with. We hope that if we can distance ourselves from others&#x2019; crises or minimize our own, we might escape their disruptiveness. But something important and meaningful is occurring in the rough patch&#x2014;even if we don&#x2019;t yet know exactly what that meaningful or important thing is. We don&#x2019;t call it a clich� when a two-year-old starts saying no, or when a teenager starts experimenting with sex; we consider these to be common expressions of what it means to be a two-year-old or a teenager. Both the toddler and the teenager are trying to grow, to become more complex and whole&#x2014;the toddler&#x2019;s task is striving for autonomy, the teenager&#x2019;s is figuring out how to be a sexual person. Though the tasks are different, the challenges of the rough patch are in some sense the same. Like the toddler and the teenager, we are looking to discover and fully express who we are, while staying connected to others. We want to take risks and feel secure. We want autonomy and connectedness in optimal balance. These are completely valid goals at any age. We have every right, and even a responsibility, to pursue them. So what makes the rough patch so rough?<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>THE MIDPOINT OF life represents the moment of maximal conflict between our drive to seek external solutions to our emotional dilemmas and our recognition that, ultimately, they don&#x2019;t work. In the rough patch we are forced to realize, often against our will, that the life-building activities of youth&#x2014;job, relationship, children, house&#x2014;have not taken care of what&#x2019;s unresolved within. We still yearn&#x2014;for what we&#x2019;re not sure&#x2014;and what we&#x2019;ve achieved doesn&#x2019;t entirely fill us.<br> <br>But it&#x2019;s not only that external achievements have not taken care of internal problems. It&#x2019;s that we&#x2019;ve begun to take a more complicated view of ourselves. By virtue of experience, we know more, and this unsettles us from three directions.<br> <br>First, we know more now about time and loss. Our own eventual mortality is becoming less of an abstraction and more of a fact. We&#x2019;ve almost inevitably suffered some disappointments and setbacks along the way. The spiritual wisdom of the ages is starting to make visceral sense. No person, job, or acquisition, no matter how wonderful, can ever entirely fill our sense of incompleteness. We even begin to sense that those who &#x201c;have everything&#x201d; are in exactly the same boat.<br> <br>Second, the passage of time gives a new urgency and poignancy to the state of our intimate relationships. This is our life. Can this relationship last for the next four decades? Is now the time to reckon with that question? We may begin to feel tendrils of doubt, the upwelling of inconvenient longings and needs, an uneasy sense that suppression or chronic discord will not be sustainable. We may encounter dread, fear, and a desire to escape through work, or screens, or drink. We&#x2019;re dimly aware we may have to lose in order to gain, that painful upheavals may be the cost of emotional growth or inner peace. Oscillating between what is and what could be, between reality and possibility, between embracing and relinquishing, we feel disoriented and confused.<br> <br>When things feel bad, two options may loom up in our minds: endure (for the children, the shared history, the finances, the stability, the vow) or strive (for something more, another chance, a better relationship). Surrender or escape. Give in or start over. Depressive resignation or manic flight. These occur to us largely because it&#x2019;s not at all clear where else to go. But the thought that soon follows is that we want to be honest, and we ask ourselves, what is the line between seizing vitality and manically defending against decline? What&#x2019;s the difference between &#x201c;settling&#x201d; and acceptance? How might the effort to have more in our lives unwittingly result in less? When does accepting limits help us to make the most of what we have, and when does it signal premature resignation? Our dawning awareness of life&#x2019;s limits means we know that we&#x2019;ve reached the point where dismantling what we have and starting something new does not come cheaply. We know there&#x2019;s really no such thing as &#x201c;starting over,&#x201d; only starting something different and trailing the inevitable complications in our wake. The acting out we see around us, which till now we&#x2019;ve casually dismissed, begins to looks like one way that people try to combat the stasis of depression with the action of escape, attempting to transcend (at least temporarily) the &#x201c;hitting a wall&#x201d; feeling that this life stage can induce.<br> <br>Finally, as time presses in, we inevitably confront questions of value. What are our values about marriage? What might it mean to stay or to go? &#x201c;An open secret in our world is that we do not know what legitimizes either divorce or marriage,&#x201d; wrote the philosopher Stanley Cavell. Deep down, many of us don&#x2019;t know where we stand on marriage. Sociologists find that people absorb highly contradictory cultural messages and hold stunningly inconsistent romantic narratives within themselves. We believe, for example, both that couples should stay together for the children and be free to pursue their own happiness. We maintain that relationships that begin with exciting strong attraction are simultaneously highly desirable and likely to be &#x201c;unrealistic.&#x201d; We espouse the romantic worldview that marriage derives meaning from the unique specialness of our mates, their status as &#x201c;one and only.&#x201d; Yet we endorse the more functionalist ethos that life is long and people &#x201c;grow apart,&#x201d; and that different people may be better partners at different stages of life. We&#x2019;re constantly trying to strike a psychic balance between the ideals of freedom and domestic life. If we are even moderately self-aware, we know enough to be suspicious of the ways our longed-for romantic and sexual experiences conform so predictably to scripts handed to us by Hollywood and advertising. But unless we can nest a sexually or romantically compelling element within our long-term relationship, we fear we won&#x2019;t make it through the decades that yawn before us.<br> <br>Trying to ground our marital values in universal principles seems next to impossible. Not many rules are left. The rules that remain are all pretty much self-assigned, and this seems true even among those who strain to obey a higher law. Studies indicate that people on the religious right divorce more often than other people, not less. Orthodox communities that insist on the sanctity of marriage vows often have benighted views of women&#x2019;s rights and purvey an oppressive model of marriage. Instead of shared social values or universal principles, the most robust determinants of whether people get married and stay married are money and education. Demographic research over the past two decades demonstrates that people who command more economic resources and education marry and stay married at higher rates than do people with fewer resource...</p><h2>An Edible Mosaic: Middle Eastern Fare with Extraordinary Flair [Middle Eastern Cookbook, 80 Recipes]</h2><p><b>Create a culinary mosaic with this Middle Eastern cookbook!</b> <br><br>When Faith Gorsky married her Syrian husband, she was introduced to a cultural and culinary world that would forever change how she experienced food and cooking.

By 1905 they had disappeared from the country. In this spirited and absorbing narrative, Brett Walker takes a deep look at the scientific, cultural, and environmental dimensions of wolf extinction in Japan and tracks changing attitudes toward nature through Japan's long history.<br><br>Grain farmers once worshiped wolves at shrines and left food offerings near their dens, beseeching the elusive canine to protect their crops from the sharp hooves and voracious appetites of wild boars and deer. Talismans and charms adorned with images of wolves protected against fire, disease, and other calamities and brought fertility to agrarian communities and to couples hoping to have children. The Ainu people believed that they were born from the union of a wolflike creature and a goddess.<br><br>In the eighteenth century, wolves were seen as rabid man-killers in many parts of Japan. Highly ritualized wolf hunts were instigated to cleanse the landscape of what many considered as demons. By the nineteenth century, however, the destruction of wolves had become decidedly unceremonious, as seen on the island of Hokkaido. Through poisoning, hired hunters, and a bounty system, one of the archipelago's largest carnivores was systematically erased.<br><br>The story of wolf extinction exposes the underside of Japan's modernization. Certain wolf scientists still camp out in Japan to listen for any trace of the elusive canines. The quiet they experience reminds us of the profound silence that awaits all humanity when, as the Japanese priest Kenko taught almost seven centuries ago, we "look on fellow sentient creatures without feeling compassion."</p><p><p>New in paperback, tells the story of how and why wolves, once considered sacred, became extinct in Japan.</p>"The Lost Wolves of Japan is not just a history of the wolf in Japan, but is also about Montana (the author's home) and North America, about nature and wilderness, and about what it is to be human and animal." - <i>Monumenta Nipponica</i> <p> "Walker has written a well-researched book with a message to all who are interested not only in our representations of wolves but in human-nature relations in general." - <i>American Historical Review</i> </p><p> "This exquisite book provides an excellent introduction to the history of taxonomy and the development of ecological science throughout the world; it is also a wonderful examination of the human dimensions of wildlife in Japan... Highly recommended." - <i>Choice</i> </p><p> "Brett Walker may be the only true environmental historian among Japanologists publishing in English. Unlike other scholars who have written on environmental themes in Japanese history (this one included), Walker's work places him squarely in the company of the leading environmental historians and ecologists. . . . (He) has given us a fascinating study of wolves and humans in early modern and modern Japan. In doing so he has raised important questions about links between changes in national identity and views of nature. He has also challenged scholars of Japanese environmental history to go beyond Japanology to situate themselves in the company of scholars of environmental history in other regions of the globe." - <i>Journal of East Asian Studies</i> </p><p> "This book's particular brilliance lies in its ability to trace the contours of this absent presence, telling us the history of wolf annihilation while revealing the impossibility of fully recovering that history... This book's immense achievement is its elucidation of the problem of writing history where all elements - human and nonhuman, climatic and cultural - are continually reconfigured. . . . <i>The Lost Wolves of Japan</i> is not only compelling environmental history but a deeply intelligent meditation on the historicity of our environment." - <i>Isis</i> </p><p> "Few books offer as intricate a view into another culture's attitudes toward an animal's extinction and disappearing wilderness as <i>The Lost Wolves of Japan</i>. Eloquently written and rich with notes that make this book highly appropriate for undergraduate and graduate course . . . <i>Lost Wolves</i> shows not only the global influences on species extinction but also how the loss of wilderness and signature species such as the wolf are deeply situated within rich, human worlds of rituals, stories, and legends that are themselves disappearing." - <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i> </p><p> "Inventive and heartfelt, <i>The Lost Wolves of Japan</i> is the kind of book many historians declare they will write when they earn tenure. But it is easy to say that you will be bold in the future. Walker actually keeps the promise." - <i>The Journal of Asian Studies</i> </p><p> "[An] excellent book. . . . Walker provides a wide-ranging perspective on the interactions between human and wolf culture, drawing on historical, religious, ecological, political, ethnological, and anthropological data - mostly from original Japanese sources. He adds a personal narrative engagement with his topic which enlivens the text and tale. Moreover, he dares to consider the fate of Japan's wolves from not only a human historian's perspective, but from what he calls a 'wolf's-eye view' of history." - <i>ISLE: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment</i> </p><p> "This is one of a small number of environmental historical studies of Japan available in English, and the skills of the author as a researcher and as a writer of prose accessible to specialist and layperson alike make it an attractive book indeed." - <i>Asahi Shimbun<i></i></i></p></p><h2>Death on a Vineyard Beach (A Martha&#39;s Vineyard Mystery, 7)</h2><p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Bullets and Bouquets</strong><p></p><p>There is no room for murder on a honeymoon.</p><p>When J.W.

He earned his M.F.A. at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. A recently retired professor of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he and his wife Shirley now live year-round on Martha's Vineyard.</p>Yet another good-natured, lethargic chronicle of the days and nights of ex-Boston cop J.W. Jackson, this time honeymooning with gorgeous nurse Zee Madeiras (A Case of Vineyard Poison, 1995, etc.) in his Martha's Vineyard cottage. A trip to Boston to see a production of Carmen puts J.W. on the scene as, leaving the theater, someone takes a shot at rich, secretive fellow islander Luciano Marcus. J.W. saves the former gangster's life, but the shooter escapes, and once back on the island, Marcus hires J.W. to find the culprit. A rundown on Marcus produces several possibilities: someone from his distant, mob-related, lucrative past; one of the local Wampanoag Indian tribe claiming ownership of a cranberry bog that's part of Marcus's extensive island estate; a local fisherman with a grudge against Marcus's equipment-damaging trawler fleet; or a member of his family impatient for a huge legacy--such as grandson Vinnie, who's been hauled back from the mainland fleshpots to work on the Marcus land and to be spoiled by Marcus's sweet wife Angela. While exploring these ideas--leisurely- -J.W. cooks up a storm; fishes, clams and sails with Zee; renews an old Vietnam comradeship; hears lots of boring philosophy from shaman Bill Vanderbeck, and encourages Zee to practice riflery and pack a gun. His slow, ruminative approach finally pays off, and life can resume its sleepy course.

But I had an escape plan. I was nearly free. Granted, I&#x2019;d botched my first attempt. Or rather, I&#x2019;d been undone by an eleventh-hour shocker completely beyond my control. But that was then. In a day or two, I&#x2019;d be in the clear. Really.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was seriously asleep when my BlackBerry chirped. When my eyes could finally recognize our alphabet, I read &#x201c;B. Stanton&#x201d; on the screen. Excellent. I&#x2019;d hoped never to see that name on myBB ever again. Yet here it was. A call from the Liberal leader&#x2019;s slippery Chief of Staff seldom sent me to my happy place. Just a day or two more.<br>&nbsp;<br>I spoke quietly, trying not to waken Lindsay beside me. I need not have worried. When she slept, she went straight to the bottom.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Daniel Addison,&#x201d; I sighed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Is that you, Addison?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Uh, no Bradley, I just open with that name to confuse callers. I&#x2019;m actually Tiger Woods,&#x201d; I replied, no longer caring about pissing him off on my way out.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Up yours!&#x201d; he roared. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got call display. Why can&#x2019;t you just pick up and say &#x2018;Hi Bradley&#x2019;? You knew it was me calling.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You mean &#x2018;You knew it was I calling,&#x2019;&#x201d; I lectured. Too often, I corrected grammar on instinct, without thinking. &#x201c;And &#x2018;up yours&#x2019; is just so . . . last century.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Fuckin&#x2019; pedant. I&#x2019;ll be gla&#x2013;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And yes, I do have call display,&#x201d; I interrupted. &#x201c;But I was praying it might be a wrong number from, say, a Bratislav Stanton, or perhaps his brother Benito. But no such luck.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I waited for him to speak but he didn&#x2019;t. So I just kept going. This was kind of fun.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;Wait, don&#x2019;t tell me, you&#x2019;re recruiting for <i>Machiavelli: The Musical </i>and I made the shortlist. I&#x2019;m touched, really I am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s just hilarious, ass-wipe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Where was he getting these archaic boys&#x2019; camp epithets?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;Have you seen the <i>Globe </i>this morning?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Bradley, it&#x2019;s 6:45. I barely have vital signs at this hour. Why?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s another fuckin&#x2019; story about you and your crazy mountain man. Are you still working the gallery for these puff pieces? &#x2019;Cause if you are, I&#x2019;ll have your nuts,&#x201d; he threatened.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Um, yours seem to be quite large enough already, Bradley. But before you have an aneurysm, I had nothing to do with the story, whatever it is. And I&#x2019;ve not pitched a single journo since the government fell,&#x201d; I said, and meant it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, the piece says your hairy friend might run again. I&#x2019;m waiting for you to tell me that&#x2019;s not true. I&#x2019;m waiting for you to tell me you&#x2019;re both heading back to your academic sandbox. I don&#x2019;t want to see either of you on the Hill again. I&#x2019;m just so tired of that &#x2018;holier than thou&#x2019; shit you and McLintock were peddling,&#x201d; Stanton barked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of course you&#x2019;re right, Bradley. Putting politics together with honesty, transparency, and the national interest, it&#x2019;s an outrage bordering on treason,&#x201d; I sneered. &#x201c;Now you listen. Don&#x2019;t get your boxers bunched up. I can tell you that neither Angus nor I has any plans to make any plans to return to politics. We didn&#x2019;t expect to be there in the first place, and I certainly have no desire to go back. I was trying to get out when all this started, remember? So I&#x2019;m done, and hearing your warm and caring voice again clinches the deal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I heard the click as he closed his cell. What a jerk. Noose or not, the political junkie in me still needed my morning fix. So in a semi-comatose stupor, I tipped myself out of bed and padded to the front door, my fingers twitching for the newspapers. The first faint traces of morning light angled into the second-storey boathouse apartment and pooled on the hardwood floor.<br>&nbsp;<br>Outside on the porch the papers lay rolled and waiting, just out of reach from the warmth, and shall we say traction, of the front hall. You&#x2019;ve heard of black ice &#x2013; that treacherous and nearly invisible glassy layer that forms on roads when certain meteorological conditions are met. Well, the McLintock boathouse has a similar phenomenon known locally as &#x201c;porch ice.&#x201d; With no eavestrough, the melting snow on the roof drips onto the porch, only to freeze when the sun drops. Angus had mentioned this danger to me in his typical engineer&#x2019;s dialect, noting something about the floorboards&#x2019; coefficient of friction dropping asymptotically to nearly zero. Right, asymptotically. So when I slipped out the front door to fetch the paper, I literally &#x201c;slipped&#x201d; out the front door.<br>&nbsp;<br>In life-threatening situations, the &#x201c;fight or flight&#x201d; instinct kicks in. Without consulting me, my body chose &#x201c;flight,&#x201d; in the truest sense of the word, so I was compelled to go along for the ride. I managed to sustain a life-saving hold on the doorknob, my only tether to earth, as my foot left the icy porch floor in a hurry. Now I&#x2019;m not what you would call coordinated . . . at all. Yet I somehow landed back on the porch without serious injury, my shimmying feet eventually coming to rest more or less under me. But naturally, my momentum slammed the door shut. Scratch that. Locked the door. Think bank vault, or Fort Knox. So there I was, marooned on my own front porch at 6:45 in the morning, the frigid day after Christmas. Did I mention that I was naked? No pants, so no pockets, so no keys.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bare hands and faces are quite accustomed to braving the harsh temperatures of winter. Other parts of the male anatomy, not so much. I felt December&#x2019;s arctic grip clamp down on my . . . situation. Like pushing an elevator button that&#x2019;s already lit, I tried the doorknob, oh, fourteen or fifteen times just to confirm with each attempt that the door was indeed still locked. It was. I then decided I had two choices. I could simply bang on the door and face the unbridled humiliation of wakening Lindsay to rescue me, or I could pry open, and crawl through, the narrow side window next to the porch. Easy call.<br>&nbsp;<br>I slid open the window without incident, even on my frictionless bare feet. I&#x2019;d not thought it possible to be any colder than I already was, until my bare chest touched the window sill. It was aluminum. When I had shoehorned myself halfway through the deceptively small opening, the &#x201c;humiliation in front of Lindsay&#x201d; scenario was looking pretty good. But things were going so well with her, with us, I decided that breaking into my own apartment, naked, was worth it.<br>&nbsp;<br>I kicked my legs gracefully, almost balletically, scraped through, and landed on the hallway floor, my forehead coming to rest on, er . . . Lindsay&#x2019;s bare feet. As I looked up, I saw that &#x201c;bare&#x201d; applied not just to her feet. She was holding her stomach and quivering. She was making a Herculean effort to keep her sides from splitting wide open. I was not blind to the humour in all of this, but I did think her hysterics took it a tad too far. In time, she gathered herself.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I often find the door works quite well also,&#x201d; she deadpanned.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, well, I was a C-section baby so I&#x2019;m drawn to windows,&#x201d; I quipped without missing a beat. I jumped to my feet to stand next to her, affecting casual indifference, as if nothing had happened. Tough to sell, with hypothermic convulsions, full-body abrasions, and a shrunken . . . ego. She shivered once, standing so close to my icy body, then headed back to bed. To complete my tribute to the Keystone Kops, the rolled-up newspapers still lay on the porch, mocking me through the window.<br>&nbsp;<br>After a scalding twenty-minute shower, I returned to bed with the newspapers and all the nonchalance I could muster. Lindsay lay beside me, apparently back in the trough of deep sleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>Boxing Day is one of my favourite days of the year. The chaos of Christmas is over, and the real relaxing begins. Because of the holiday, the papers were thinner than usual, but the story Bradley had called about actually appeared in both the <i>Cumberland Crier </i>and the <i>Globe and Mail</i>. I hadn&#x2019;t been completely honest with <i>Darth </i>Bradley. I knew that Andr� Fontaine, staff writer for our local paper, the <i>Crier</i>, was working on a feature and had hoped to get broader placement of it. He couldn&#x2019;t have done much better than our national newspaper.<br>&nbsp;<br>I propped myself up on my pillows, taking care not to shake the bed unduly, and opened the <i>Globe</i>. Four photos accompanied the story. There was a shot of Professor Angus McLintock receiving a teaching award from the U of O Engineering Society. Another showed him sitting in <i>Baddeck 1</i>, the hovercraft he&#x2019;d designed and built in the boathouse workshop below me. Yet another photo, taken just outside the House of Commons, featured Angus flanked by yours truly and Muriel Parkinson, whose smile actually made her look younger than her eighty-one years. Finally, there was a stock photo of disgraced former Finance Minister and Cumberland-Prescott MP, the Honourable Eric Cameron, likely taken after presenting his last federal budget and well before the cataclysm of a couple of months ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lindsay stirred beside me, then was still again.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was surreal to see my own name in a <i>Globe and Mail </i>headline.<br>&nbsp;<br>McLintock and Addison &#x2013; Cutting a new path in politics<br>&nbsp;<br>It was a bit over the top in my view. Then there was the subhead to fill in the holes in the headline.<br>&nbsp;<br>Behind the partnership that brought down a government<br>&nbsp;<br>Please. It made us sound so much more purposeful and calculating than we had actually been. Really, I&#x2019;d had very little to do with it all. The Tories had gambled that the snowstorm of the decade would maroon most MPs in their ridings. It was Angus who had rocketed up the frozen Ottawa River in <i>Baddeck 1 </i>all the way to Parliament Hill. I was just a spectator in the gallery when he burst onto the floor of the House, his wild grey hair and swirling beard in full fright, just in time to cast the deciding vote. But like the intoxicating aroma that often leads me three blocks out of my way to the nearest Cinnabon outlet, the headline and subhead are intended to seize your attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>I settled in to read the piece. Lindsay still looked as if she were asleep beside me but her roving hands beneath the comforter told a different story. Focus, Daniel, focus. Andr�&#x2019;s story covered the whirlwind of the last two and a half months, including my abrupt resignation from my speech-writing gig in the Liberal Leader&#x2019;s office and my guilt-driven promise on my way out to find a Liberal candidate to run in my new home riding of Cumberland-Prescott. Never mind that it was the safest Conservative seat in the land.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I feared, Andr� revealed the bargain I had struck with my new landlord, Angus McLintock. I&#x2019;d admitted nothing in my interview, but honest Angus had freely confessed he agreed to let his name stand as the no-hope Liberal sacrificial lamb only after I promised to teach his English for Engineers class, a quadrennial duty he absolutely loathed. I was surprised to see that Andr� had included a nice quotation from my PhD thesis supervisor noting how pleased he was that I&#x2019;d agreed to join the English faculty at Ottawa U.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lindsay&#x2019;s sub-sheet ministrations moved quickly from distracting to arousing, but I had almost finished the story. The hint of a smile on her tranquil face confirmed that she was not in the throes of some strange, yet wholly satisfying, sleep disorder.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Just a couple more paragraphs, Linds, and I&#x2019;m all yours. I&#x2019;m just getting to the good part.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; she whispered, still smiling.<br>&nbsp;<br>She redoubled her efforts as if I&#x2019;d said nothing at all, which, frankly, worked out pretty well for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Andr� had some fun with the leather-studded late-campaign stunner, describing how the wildly popular incumbent MP and Finance Minister Eric Cameron inadvertently went public with his S&amp;M secret. You don&#x2019;t often see words like &#x201c;alligator clip&#x201d; and &#x201c;crotchless rubber suit&#x201d; living in the same sentence alongside &#x201c;Finance Minister.&#x201d; So I savoured the moment. Even Muriel made it into the article. Andr� described her as the spirited eighty-something Liberal warhorse who had stood for the Liberals against the Tory tide in C-P for five elections in a row. Nicely put. I wondered how Lindsay&#x2019;s grandmother would take the &#x201c;warhorse&#x201d; reference, before deciding she&#x2019;d probably wear it with pride.<br>&nbsp;<br>By this time, Lindsay had shed any pretence of sleep and thrown herself into her work. She was quite good at it, too. My concentration flagged as I tried to make it to the end of the article while also thinking hard about baseball. And hockey, and football. Did I mention baseball? Almost there. Just a few more paragraphs. Bear down, Daniel. Down.<br>&nbsp;<br>The article couldn&#x2019;t quite capture the full impact of Angus McLintock&#x2019;s stunning upset and his honest, forthright, and refreshing approach to public service. Yet it was all true. Against all odds, against more than a century of local political tradition, and definitely against the wishes of Angus McLintock, it was all true. Despite outward appearances of a carefully orchestrated grand plan, we&#x2019;d simply been lurching from one issue to the next, trying to do the right thing. Who could have foreseen Angus McLintock&#x2019;s Midas touch? I certainly hadn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>The last line of the feature really said it all.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&#x201c;With the government defeated and another election looming, the burning questions are: Will Angus McLintock seek re-election for a job he never wanted in the first place? And will Daniel Addison still be at his side?&#x201d;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No and no,&#x201d; I intoned out of nowhere, in a louder voice than I&#x2019;d intended.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lindsay clearly wasn&#x2019;t taking no for an answer, and launched into new techniques well beyond my thin playbook. I do have my limits. I jettisoned the paper as if it were on fire.<br>&nbsp;<br>An hour later, when we&#x2019;d both finished, the <i>Globe </i>story I mean, Lindsay set down the paper.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well? Did Andr� nail it?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He got the history right, but he&#x2019;s got the future all wrong,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, Angus and I are heading back to the peace and quiet of the university. He didn&#x2019;t want to win. I didn&#x2019;t want him to win. The collapse of the government just means we can now go back to our regularly scheduled lives.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Lindsay smiled and looked down. I thought I might even have detected a faint shake of her head.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m with Grandma. I think Angus was surprised to discover that he actually liked being an MP. And I think you actually quite liked being his EA.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Despite what Muriel and you believe, I think I know Angus pretty well. He will not run again,&#x201d; I concluded. &#x201c;You can flip us both over and grab the barbecue sauce, we&#x2019;re done.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>We lay in peace for a time.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What a wonderful few weeks it&#x2019;s been,&#x201d; Lindsay sighed and rested her head on my chest.

Instead of turning away from difference in fear or mistrust, Personal Leadership helps people engage with difference from a place of inspiration, curiosity, and full intelligence, and in alignment with their highest and best. The three authors have extensive personal experience working and living across cultures and in situations of difference, in both domestic and global contexts. The fifty stories used throughout the book to illustrate the core themes are drawn from their own lives and from those of the many Personal Leadership practitioners in global business, international education, diversity initiatives, team building, community building, international cooperation, and leadership development. Together they show how we can use Personal Leadership when we find ourselves in unfamiliar environments, in contexts that are rapidly changing, or in the midst of personal or professional transition. The book is well-written, easy to read, and intends to help us all &#34;make a world of difference.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Passage of Arms: A Suspense Thriller</h2><p>In this classic thriller, two American tourists find more adventure than they bargained for when they get involved with Chinese gun smugglers and Muslim revolutionaries, learning first hand about the intrigue of the post-colonial world.<br><br>Greg and Dorothy Nilsen had wanted to go on an adventurous trip, see some of the more out-of-the-way places.

Before turning to writing full-time, he worked at an engineering firm, and wrote copy for an advertising agency. His first novel was published in 1936. During the course of his career, Ambler was awarded two Gold Daggers, a Sliver Dagger, and a Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers Association of Great Britain, named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers Association of America, and made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the Queen Elizabeth. In addition to his novels, Ambler wrote a number of screenplays, including <b>A Night to Remember</b><i> </i>and <b>The Cruel Sea</b>,<i> </i>which won him an Oscar nomination.

But alas, his postings are more grim than glamorous. Luckily, Wilderness has a knack for doing well for himself even in the most unpromising postings, though this has gotten him into hot water in the past. A coffee-smuggling gig in divided Berlin was a steady money-maker but things went pear-shaped when he had to smuggle a spy back to the KGB instead. In the wake of what became an embarrassing disaster for MI6, Wilderness is reprimanded with a posting to remote northern Finland, under the guise of a cultural exchange program to promote Britain abroad. Bored by his work, with nothing to spy on, Wilderness finds another way to make money, this time by smuggling vodka across the rather porous border into the USSR. He strikes a deal with his old KGB pal Kostya, who explains to him there is, no joke, a vodka shortage in the Soviet Union, following a grain famine caused by Khrushchev&#x2019;s new agricultural policies. But there is something fishy about why Kostya has suddenly turned up in Finland&#x2015;and MI6 intelligence from London points to a connection to the mining of cobalt in the region, a critical component in the casing of the atomic bomb. Wilderness&#x2019;s posting is getting more interesting by the minute, but more dangerous too.<br><p><br>Moving from the no-man&#x2019;s-land of Cold War Finland to the wild days of the Prague Spring, and populated by old friends (including Inspector Troy) and old enemies alike, <i>Hammer to Fall</i> is a gripping tale of deception and skullduggery, of art and politics, a page-turning story of the always riveting life of the British spy.</p></p><p><b>John Lawton</b> has written eight previous Inspector Troy thrillers, two novels starring Joe Wilderness, one standalone novel, and a volume of history.

Tolkien&#x201d; (A. N. Wilson), this award-winning biography explores J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s wartime experiences and their impact on his life and his writing of <i>The Hobbit </i>and <i>The Lord of The Rings.</i></b></p>&#x201c;To be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than in 1939 . . . By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.&#x201d;<br> So J.R.R. Tolkien responded to critics who saw <i>The Lord of the Rings </i>as a reaction to the Second World War. <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i> tells for the first time the full story of how he embarked on the creation of Middle-earth in his youth as the world around him was plunged into catastrophe. This biography reveals the horror and heroism that he experienced as a signals officer in the Battle of the Somme and introduces the circle of friends who spurred his mythology to life. It shows how, after two of these brilliant young men were killed, Tolkien pursued the dream they had all shared by launching his epic of good and evil.<br> John Garth argues that the foundation of tragic experience in the First World War is the key to Middle-earth&#x2019;s enduring power. Tolkien used his mythic imagination not to escape from reality but to reflect and transform the cataclysm of his generation. While his contemporaries surrendered to disillusionment, he kept enchantment alive, reshaping an entire literary tradition into a form that resonates to this day.<br> This is the first substantially new biography of Tolkien since 1977, meticulously researched and distilled from his personal wartime papers and a multitude of other sources.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very much the best book about J.R.R. Tolkien that has yet been written.&#x201d; &#x2014; A. N. Wilson<br><br> &#x201c;A highly intelligent book . . . Garth displays impressive skills both as researcher and writer.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; Max Hastings<br><br> &#x201c;It is a strange story that Garth tells, but he tells it clearly and compellingly.&#x201d; &#x2014; Tom Shippey<br><br> &#x201c;Somewhere, I think, Tolkien is nodding in appreciation.&#x201d; &#x2014; Charles Matthews, <i>San Jose Mercury News</i><br><br> &#x201c;Gripping from start to finish and offers important new insights.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Library Journal</i><br><br> &#x201c;A labor of love in which journalist Garth combines a newsman&#x2019;s nose for a good story with a scholar&#x2019;s scrupulous attention to detail . . .

Tolkien&#x2019;s fantasy world as the result of Peter Jackson&#x2019;s three-part cinematic interpretation of the great 20th century fantasy. John Garth&#x2019;s <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i> will certainly captivate an elite segment of those recent converts, but it is written more for those who have long been enthralled by Middle-earth and its fantastic denizens. While many early readers found parallels between World War II and the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fairy-tale, Garth reaches back to World War I to find the deep roots in Middle-earth. Prior to the Great War, Tolkien was a scholar with a deep passion for language and fables. In fact, he formed a literary circle with a few friends dubbed the Tea Club and Barrovian Society. Its members had the misfortune of coming of age just as the war was reaching a fevered pitch; Tolkien, a second lieutenant in the British army, survived the bloody Battle of the Somme, which took the lives of two of his closest friends. Garth adeptly chronicles how the devastation Tolkien witnessed helped shape the mythic tale that was already brewing in his mind. Written with a seriousness one associates with the time it chronicles, <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i> is a erudite but eminently readable exploration of how the harsh reality of the early 20th century colored one of the beloved fantasies of the modern era. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>John Garth, winner of the 2004 Mythopoeic Society Scholarship Award, studied English at Oxford University and has since worked as a newspaper journalist in London. A long-standing taste for the works of Tolkien, combined with an interest in the First World War, fueled the five years of research that have gone into Tolkien and the Great War and he has drawn extensively on previously unpublished personal papers as well as Tolkien&#39;s service record and other unique military documents.</p><h2>Hans Christian Andersen: Fairy Tales</h2><p>A new selection of 30 tales to mark the 200 year anniversary of Andersen&#39;s birth in 2005. Tiina Nunnally&#39;s sparkling translation captures the rawness and immediacy of Andersen&#39;s style, for the first time enabling English readers to be as startled and amazed as his original readers were, and revealing the unique inventiveness of Andersen&#39;s genius. At a time when children&#39;s stories were formal, moral and didactic, Hans Christian Andersen revolutionized the genre, giving an anarchic twist to traditional folklore and creating a huge number of utterly original stories that sprang directly from his imagination. From the exuberant early stories such as The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&#39;, though poignant masterpieces such as The Little Mermaid&#39; and The Ugly Duckling&#39;, to the darker, more subversive later tales written for adults, the stories included here are endlessly experimental, both humorous and irreverent, sorrowful and strange. This book beautifully illustrated with a selection of Andersen&#39;s amazing paper cut-outs - will bring these magical tales to life for readers of any age.</p><p>"Hans Christian Andersen is one of the canonical storytellers of the nineteenth century, equally disturbing and delighting for adults as for children. There have been some capable versions available in English, but Tiina Nunnally's seems to me the best. Jackie Wullschlager's introduction will be of enormous value to the reader."<br> -Harold Bloom <br><br> "Tiina Nunnally's new versions of the tales amount to a recuperation of Andersen, in all his strangeness, darkness and comic subversiveness--and Jackie Wullschlager's introduction is invaluable."<br> -John Banville <br><br> "A most welcome new edition. Tiina Nunnally's excellent translation brings the stories to life, while Jackie Wullschlager's scholarly introduction serves as an enlightening complement to the text. I much enjoyed revisiting these seminal tales."<br> -Penelope Lively <br><br> "Jackie Wullschlager's introduction and Tiina Nunnally's translation both succeed admirably in catching the wonderful mixture of tradition-hallowed simplicity and eerie originality that are characteristic of Hans Christian Andersen and his stories."<br> -Robert Irwin <br><br> "Children, prepare yourselves to be delighted. Adults, you are at the mercy of a compelling master storyteller whose gifts are a sweeping imagination, the sorcery of language, and whose tales will leave you amused, joyful, charmed, sometimes perplexed, but most of all, pondering. Don't be surprised if the veiled character studies reveal yourselves, or if bizarre happenings offer a truth you need to know. Through Tiina Nunnally's fresh and sensitive translation, the imagery and subtleties of Andersen's prose shine."<br> -Susan VreelandHans Christian Andersen (1805-75) was born in Odense, Denmark, the son of a poor shoemaker and a washerwoman. As a young teenager, he became quite well known in Odense as a reciter of drama, and as a singer. When he was fourteen, he set off for the capital, Copenhagen, determined to become a national success on the stage. He failed miserably, but made some influential friends in the capital, who got him into school to remedy his lack of proper education. He hated school: aged seventeen, he was in a class of twelve-year-olds and was constantly mocked by them and by the teachers. In 1829 his first book - an account of a walking trip - was published. After that, books came out at regular intervals. At first, he considered his adult books more important than his fantasies. In later life, however, he began to see that these apparently trivial stories could vividly portray constant features of human life and character, in a charming manner. There were two consequences of this. First, he stopped regarding his stories as trifles written solely for children; second, he began to write more original stories, rather than retelling traditional tales. He once said that ideas for stories `lie in my mind like seeds and only need the kiss of a sunbeam or a drop of malice to flower&#39;. He would often thinly disguise people he liked or disliked as characters in his stories: a woman who failed to return his love becomes the foolish prince in `The Little Mermaid&#39;; his own ugliness and humiliation, or his father&#39;s daydream of being descended from a rich and powerful family, are reflected in `The Ugly Duckling&#39;. Hans Andersen&#39;s stories began to be translated into English as early as 1846. Since then, numerous editions, and more recently Hollywood songs and a Disney cartoon, have helped to ensure the continuing popularity of the stories in the English-speaking world.

In the first two volumes which have sold well, Black Star: The African Presence in Early Europe, and African Star over Asia: The African Presence in the East he interpreted the work of earlier scholars and provided new evidence of the important historical role of Black people in Europe and Asia. This new book pays tribute to the great scholar, Ivan Van Sertima, author of They Came before Columbus and founder of the Journal of African Civilizations. It brings together the author&#39;s own research and that of Van Sertima and other Black scholars including Chancellor Williams, William Leo Hansberry, John G.Jackson and Cheikh Anta Diop. It discusses the origins, the nature and the historical development of the civilisations, providing details of the dynasties. It throws light on African links with Sumer, South Asia and, not least, the Olmec and their successors in Mexico. It punctures several racial myths including those relating to anthropological theory.</p><p>Runoko Rashidi (born 1954) is a historian, essayist, author and public lecturer based in Los Angeles, California and Paris, France. He is the author of Introduction to the Study of African Classical Civilizations (1993) and the editor of Unchained African Voices, a collection of poetry and prose by Death Row inmates at California&#39;s San Quentin maximum-scurity prison. He is a member of the editorial board of The Journal of Pan African Studies (www.jpanafrican.com), and he holds an honorary doctorate of divinity from Amen-Ra Theological Seminary (Los Angeles, California).</p><h2>Psalms 1-50 (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, OT Volume 7)</h2><p>The Psalms have long served a vital role in the individual and corporate lives of Christians, expressing the full range of human emotions, including some that we are ashamed to admit. The Psalms reverberate with joy, groan in pain, whimper with sadness, grumble in disappointment and rage with anger. The church fathers employed the Psalms widely. In liturgy they used them both as hymns and as Scripture readings. Within them they found pointers to Jesus both as Son of God and as Messiah. They also employed the Psalms widely as support for other New Testament teachings, as counsel on morals and as forms for prayer. But the church fathers found more than pastoral insight in the Psalms. They found apologetic and doctrinal insight as well, as is attested by the more than sixty-five authors and more than 160 works excerpted in this commentary. Especially noteworthy among the Greek-speaking authors cited are Hippolytus, Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea, Athanasius, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Didymus the Blind, Evagrius of Pontus, Diodore of Tarsus, John Chrysostom, Asterius the Homilist, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyr, Cyril of Alexandria and Hesychius of Jerusalem. Among noteworthy Latin authors we find Hilary of Poitiers, Ambrose of Milan, Jerome, Augustine, Arnobius the Younger and Cassiodorus. Readers of these selections, some of which appear here for the first time in English, will glean from a rich treasury of deep devotion and profound theological reflection.</p><p>About the Series <p>The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture (ACCS) does what very few of today's students of the Bible could do for themselves. With the aid of computer technology, the vast array of writings from the church fathers--including much that is available only in the ancient languages--have been combed for their comment on Scripture. From these results, scholars with a deep knowledge of the fathers and a heart for the church have hand selected material for each volume, shaping, annotating and introducing it to today's readers. Each portion of commentary has been chosen for its salient insight, its rhetorical power and its faithful representation of the consensual exegesis of the early church. </p><p>The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture is an ecumenical project, promoting a vital link of communication between the varied Christian traditions of today and their common ancient ancestors in the faith. On this shared ground we listen as leading pastoral theologians of six centuries gather around the text of Scripture and offer their best theological, spiritual and pastoral insights. </p><p>Today the historical-critical method of interpretation has nearly exhausted its claim on the biblical text and on the church. In its wake there is a widespread yearning among Christian individuals and communities for the wholesome, the deep and the enduring.

June 6, 1944 - D-Day. The day when, after years of preparation, Germany&#39;s opponents in the west - the USA and England - began the second front, long demanded by Stalin to take pressure off the Red Army.

This Is Why They Are</b><br>&nbsp;<br>A few years ago, the evolutionary psychologist Gordon Gallup, whom we&#x2019;ll meet again later in this section, along with his colleagues Mary Finn and Becky Sammis, set out to explain the natural origins of the only human male body part arguably less attractive than the penis&#x2014;the testicles. In many respects, their so-called activation hypothesis elaborates on what many of us already know about descended scrotal testicles: they serve as a sort of cold storage and production unit for sperm, which keep best at a temperature slightly lower than the norm for the rest of our bodies. But the activation hypothesis goes much further than this fun fact.<br>It turns out that human testicles display some rather elaborate yet subtle temperature-regulating features that have gone largely unnoticed by doctors, researchers, and laymen alike. The main tenet of the activation hypothesis is that the heat of a woman&#x2019;s vagina radically jump-starts sperm that have been hibernating in the cool, airy scrotal sac. This heat aids conception. Yet it explains many other things too, including why one testicle is usually slightly lower than the other, why the skin of the scrotum sometimes becomes rugose (prune-like and as wrinkled as an elephant&#x2019;s elbow), why the testicles retract during sexual arousal, and even why testicular injuries&#x2014;compared with other types of bodily assaults&#x2014;are so excruciatingly painful.<br>To help us all get on the same page, consider an alternate reality, one in which ovaries, like testicles, descend during embryological development and emerge outside the female body cavity in a thin, unprotected sac. After you&#x2019;ve wiped that image from your mind&#x2019;s eye, note that the dangling gonads of many male animals (including humans) are no less puzzling. After all, why in all of evolution would nature have designed a body part with such obviously enormous reproductive importance to hang outside the body, so defenseless and vulnerable? We tend to become accustomed to our body parts, and it often fails to occur to us to even ask why they are the way they are. Some of the biggest evolutionary mysteries are also the most mundane aspects of our lives.<br>So the first big question is why so many mammalian species evolved hanging scrotal testicles to begin with. The male gonads in some phylogenetic lineages went in completely different directions, evolutionarily speaking. For example, modern elephant testicles are deeply embedded in the body cavity (a trait referred to as testicond), whereas other mammals, such as seals, have descended testicles but are without scrota, with the gonads simply being subcutaneous.<br>Gallup and his colleagues jog through several possible theories of our species&#x2019; testicular evolution by descent. One of the more fanciful accounts&#x2014;and one ultimately discarded by the researchers&#x2014;is that scrotal testicles evolved in the same spirit as peacock feathers. That is to say, given the enormous disadvantage of having your entire genetic potential contained in a thin satchel of unprotected, delicate flesh and swinging several millimeters away from the rest of your body, perhaps scrotal testicles evolved as a sort of ornamental display communicating the genetic quality of the male. In evolutionary biology, this type of adaptationist account appeals to the handicapping principle. The theoretical gist of the handicapping principle is that if the organism can thrive and survive while still being hobbled by a costly, maladaptive trait such as elaborate, cumbersome plumage or (in this case) vulnerably drooping gonads, then it must have some high-quality genes and be a valuable mate.<br>But the handicapping hypothesis doesn&#x2019;t quite fit the case of descended scrotal testicles, explain the authors, because if it were true, then we would expect to see these body parts becoming increasingly elaborate and dangly over the course of evolution, not to mention that women should display a preference for males toting around the most ostentatious scrotal baggage. &#x201c;With the possible exception of colored scrota among a few species of primates,&#x201d; writes Gallup, &#x201c;there is little evidence that this has been the case.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not aware of any studies on intraspecies individual variation in scrotal design, but I&#x2019;m nonetheless willing to speculate that most human males have rather bland, run-of-the-mill scrota. Anything deviating from this&#x2014;particularly a set of unusually pendulous testicles suspended in knee-length scrota&#x2014;is probably more likely to have a woman dry heaving, screaming, or staring in confusion rather than serving as an aphrodisiac.<br>Again, a more likely explanation for scrotal descent, and one that has been around for some time, is that sperm production and storage are maximized at cooler temperatures. &#x201c;Not only is the skin of the scrotal sac thin to promote heat dissipation,&#x201d; the authors write, &#x201c;the arteries that supply blood to the scrotum are positioned adjacent to the veins taking blood away from the scrotum and function as an additional cooling/heating exchange mechanism. As a consequence of these adaptations average scrotal temperatures in humans are typically 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius lower than body temperature (37 degrees Celsius), and spermatogenesis is most efficient at 34 degrees Celsius.&#x201d;<br>Sperm are extraordinarily sensitive to even minor fluctuations in climate. When the ambient temperature rises to body levels, there is a momentary increase in sperm motility (they become more lively), but only for a period of time before fizzing out. To be more exact, sperm thrive at body temperature for fifty minutes to four hours, the length of time it takes for them to journey through the female reproductive tract and fertilize the egg. But once the spermatic atmosphere rises much above 37 degrees Celsius, the chances for a successful insemination consequently plummet&#x2014;any viable sperm become the equivalent of burned toast. So in other words, except during sex, when it&#x2019;s adaptive for sperm to be hyperactive, sperm are stored and produced most efficiently in the cool, breezy surroundings of the relaxed scrotal sac. One doesn&#x2019;t want his scrotum to be too cold, however, since nature has calibrated these temperature points at precisely defined optimal levels.<br>Fortunately, human scrota don&#x2019;t just hang there holding our testicles and brewing our sperm; they also &#x201c;actively&#x201d; employ some interesting thermoregulatory tactics to protect and promote males&#x2019; genetic interests. I place &#x201c;actively&#x201d; in scare quotes, of course, because, although it would be rather odd to ascribe consciousness to human scrota, testicles do respond unintentionally to the reflexive actions of the cremasteric muscle. This muscle serves to retract the testicles so they are drawn up closer to the body when it gets too cold&#x2014;just think cold shower&#x2014;and also to relax them when it gets too hot. This up-and-down action happens on a moment-to-moment basis; thus male bodies continually optimize the gonadal climate for spermatogenesis and sperm storage. It&#x2019;s also why it&#x2019;s generally inadvisable for men to wear tight-fitting jeans or especially snug &#x201c;tighty whities&#x201d;; under these restrictive conditions the testicles are shoved up against the body and artificially warmed so that the cremasteric muscle cannot do its job properly. Another reason not to wear these things is that it&#x2019;s no longer 1988.<br>Now, I know what you&#x2019;re thinking. &#x201c;But, Dr. Bering, how do you account for the fact that testicles are rarely perfectly symmetrical in their positioning within the same scrotum?&#x201d; In fact, the temperature-regulating function governed by the cremasteric muscle can account even for the most lopsided, one-testicle-above-the-other, waffling asymmetries in testes positioning. According to a 2009 report in <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> by the anatomist Stany Lobo and his colleagues, each testicle continuously migrates in its own orbit as a way of maximizing the available scrotal surface area that is subjected to heat dissipation and cooling. Like ambient heat generated by individual solar panels, when it comes to spermatic temperatures, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. With a keen enough eye, presumably one could master the art of &#x201c;reading&#x201d; testicle alignment, using the scrotum as a makeshift room thermometer. But that&#x2019;s just me speculating.<br>From an evolutionary perspective, the design of male genitalia makes sense only to the extent that it adaptively complements the female anatomy, which, I realize, I should really go into more (but there are only so many hours in a day). By contrast to males, unless a woman is engaging in strenuous exercise, the female reproductive tract is maintained continuously at standard body temperature. This is the crux of Gallup&#x2019;s activation hypothesis: the rise in temperature surrounding sperm as occasioned by ejaculation into the vagina &#x201c;activates&#x201d; sperm, temporarily making them frenetic and therefore enabling them to acquire the necessary oomph to penetrate the cervix and reach the fallopian tubes. &#x201c;In our view,&#x201d; write the authors, &#x201c;descended scrotal testicles evolved to both capitalize on this copulation/insemination contingent temperature enhancement and function to prevent premature activation of sperm by keeping testicular temperatures below the critical value set by body temperatures.&#x201d;<br>One of the things you may have noticed in your own genitalia or those of someone you&#x2019;re especially close to is that in contrast to the slackened scrotal skin accompanying flaccid, nonaroused states, penile erections are usually accompanied by a telltale retraction of the testicles closer to the body.

Welcome to gamespace. Gamespace is where and how we live today. It is everywhere and nowhere: the main chance, the best shot, the big leagues, the only game in town. In a world thus configured, McKenzie Wark contends, digital computer games are the emergent cultural form of the times. Where others argue obsessively over violence in games, Wark approaches them as a utopian version of the world in which we actually live. Playing against the machine on a game console, we enjoy the only truly level playing field--where we get ahead on our strengths or not at all. </p><p><i>Gamer Theory</i> uncovers the significance of games in the gap between the near-perfection of actual games and the highly imperfect gamespace of everyday life in the rat race of free-market society. The book depicts a world becoming an inescapable series of less and less perfect games. This world gives rise to a new persona. In place of the subject or citizen stands the gamer. As all previous such personae had their breviaries and manuals, <i>Gamer Theory</i> seeks to offer guidance for thinking within this new character. Neither a strategy guide nor a cheat sheet for improving one's score or skills, the book is instead a primer in thinking about a world made over as a gamespace, recast as an imperfect copy of the game.</p></p><p>McKenzie Wark is Professor of Cultural and Media Studies at Eugene Lang College and The New School for Social Research. He is the author of several books, most recently <b><i>The Beach Beneath the Street</i>. </b>One of the more astute media theorists currently at work, Wark is going for major bonus points with&nbsp;<i>Gamer Theory,</i>&nbsp;and he indeed racks them up.&nbsp;<i>Gamer Theory</i>&nbsp;opens a new level for media studies, offering a successor paradigm to the culture industry thesis..l and the spectacle society critique of the Situationists.-- Vince Carducci (Popmatters)<br><br>This is only a book about video games in the way that the story of Noah's Ark is about the weather.-- Laura Stokes (<i>Brooklyn Rail</i>)<br><br>Wark goes deep into many subtle mechanisms... Results are controversial as any Wark effort, but they are provocative and sometimes really inspiring, so often opening new possible paths for interpreting games and even different other digital environments.<i><i>-- Alessandro Ludovico (Neural Magazine)</i></i><em> </em><br><br>Not since&nbsp;Steal This Book&nbsp;has a book's radical packaging so threatened to upstage its radical content.<i><i>-- Julian Dibbell (Village Voice)</i></i><em> </em></p><h2>The Boat of Longing (Borealis Books)</h2><p>From the rocky, mist-enshrouded shores of Norway to the bustling streets of Minneapolis, O.

Our destructive ways did not come haphazardly into existence; they spring from a particular attitude toward the earth and our relation to it, and it is that attitude that these essays address. Dharma is the Buddhist teaching; Gaia is the concept of the earth as a living being, an organism that is whole the way a body is, each part of it inseparable from the rest. When you look at the earth through the eyes of Buddhism, you arrive at a picture very like Gaia: the idea of the interdependency of all things is at the heart of Buddhism. Damage one element, and you damage the whole. This is in the spiritual realm what ecology is in the scientific, and so the two systems of thought lead naturally into each other. The essays in this book come at the subject from different angles, all the way from Christopher Reed's Eco-Precepts ("I vow to recycle everything I can") to David Abram's philosophical look at how the Gaia hypothesis influences our perception, to Joanna Macy's thoughts on "the greening of self' - the change from the self as a separate entity to the self as "coextensive with other beings and the life of our planet." Some essays - such as Macy's - are thought-provoking and lively. Others are more dutiful, more academic. But on the whole, the good essays make up for the poorer ones, and the matching of Buddhism with ecology points us in fruitful directions. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Prague: A Traveler&#39;s Literary Companion (Traveler&#39;s Literary Companions)</h2><p>Travel to one of the most beautiful cities in the world in the company of its finest writers. Walk the mysterious nighttime streets of Prague with Franz Kafka and Jaroslav Hasek, eavesdrop on intimate conversations in restaurants and lively beer halls with Karel Capek and Bohumil Hrabal, listen to jazz in stylish nightclubs with Josef Skvorecky. The stories in this volume &#x2014; many of which appear in English for the first time &#x2014; will take you on a personal odyssey through the city's stormy past to its dynamic present. For the traveler who wishes to experience something of its essence, Prague illuminates the heart and soul of a great city. Contributors include Michal Ajvaz, Karel Capek, Ivan Divis, Jaroslav Hasek, Daniela Hodrova, Bohumil Hrabal, Alois Jirasek, Franz Kafka, Jiri Karasek ze Lvovic, Egon Erwin Kisch, Ivan Klima, Jiri Kovtun, Frantisek Langer, Gustav Meyrink, Jan Neruda, Karel Pecka, Ota Pavel, Josef Skvorecky, Jindriska Smetanova, Jachym Topol, and Jiri Weil.</p><p>The city of Prague has inspired a lot of fine literature, and Paul Wilson has done the English-speaking world a vast favor by compiling this anthology of 23 Prague stories. There are classics by the likes of Franz Kafka, Jan Neruda, and Ivan Klima, and lesser-known works making their English-translation debuts. There are autobiographical pieces, fiction, legend, stories from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, tales from the Soviet regime, and contemporary pieces from the Czech Republic. Ivan Klima&#39;s epilogue is titled &#34;The Spirit of Prague,&#34; and after reviewing Prague&#39;s history--cultural and political--he concludes that paradox is at Prague&#39;s heart, and irony and ridicule are its primary tools. Both devices are employed deftly throughout Wilson&#39;s anthology, providing clever, lyrical, and moving snippets of Prague&#39;s complex reality.Paul Wilson, Editor</p><h2>Learn Better: Mastering the Skills for Success in Life, Business, and School, or How to Become an Expert in Just About Anything</h2><p>For centuries, experts have argued that learning was about memorizing information: You're supposed to study facts, dates, and details; burn them into your memory; and then apply that knowledge at opportune times. But this approach to learning isn&#x2019;t nearly enough for the world that we live in today, and in <i>Learn Better </i>journalist and education researcher Ulrich Boser demonstrates that <i>how</i> we learn can matter just as much as what we learn.<br><br>In this brilliantly researched book, Boser maps out the new science of learning, showing how simple techniques like comprehension check-ins and making material personally relatable can help people gain expertise in dramatically better ways. He covers six key steps to help you &#x201c;learn how to learn,&#x201d; all illuminated with fascinating stories like how Jackson Pollock developed his unique painting style and why an ancient Japanese counting device allows kids to do math at superhuman speeds. Boser&#x2019;s witty, engaging writing makes this book feel like a guilty pleasure, not homework.<br><i><br>Learn Better</i> will revolutionize the way students and society alike approach learning and makes the case that being smart is not an innate ability&#x2014;learning is a skill everyone can master. With Boser as your guide, you will be able to fully capitalize on your brain&#x2019;s remarkable ability to gain new skills and open up a whole new world of possibilities.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2017:</strong> I recently tested my family&#x2019;s patience for weeks as I announced during dinner, &#x201c;I discovered something today,&#x201d; and then related a new technique for learning I&#x2019;d read in <em>Learn Better</em>. What my family didn&#x2019;t realize at the time was that by teaching them what I&#x2019;d learned, I myself was absorbing the lesson better than I would have if I&#x2019;d just reread it again. That was only one of dozens of methods I&#x2019;d consumed in <em>Learn Better</em> to help me understand, retain, and connect information better than through the old (and less effective) systems of highlighting and rereading. Boser&#x2019;s smart and approachable writing style engaged me at once as he laid out six methods for becoming an expert at whatever you like, whether it&#x2019;s basketball, parenting, or quantum physics. Experiments, data, and anecdotes back up his techniques, but almost as important, he explains learning in such a clear way that aha! moments abound. &#x201c;Learning does not have a comfort zone,&#x201d; he says, following up later with: &#x201c;To develop a skill, we&#x2019;re going to be uncomfortable, strained, often feeling a little embattled.&#x201d; He emphasizes that expertise is not the most important quality of an effective educator: &#x201c;We need instructors that know their subject&#x2014;and know ways to explain their subject.&#x201d; Boser even puts himself of the spot, suggesting that readers should question whether they believe an author&#x2019;s arguments in order to bring analytical thinking to a subject, which will cement that knowledge (or their rejection of the author&#x2019;s thesis) deeper in their brains. There&#x2019;s a lot to absorb here, but happily you have an expert teacher guiding you now on your own path toward effective learning. <em>--Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>ULRICH BOSER</b> is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.

The term burst forth in public discourse in the spring of 1992 as a way to describe Serbian attacks on the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but as this landmark book attests, ethnic cleansing is neither new nor likely to cease in our time.</p><p>Norman Naimark, distinguished historian of Europe and Russia, provides an insightful history of ethnic cleansing and its relationship to genocide and population transfer. Focusing on five specific cases, he exposes the myths about ethnic cleansing, in particular the commonly held belief that the practice stems from ancient hatreds. Naimark shows that this face of genocide had its roots in the European nationalism of the late nineteenth century but found its most virulent expression in the twentieth century as modern states and societies began to organize themselves by ethnic criteria. The most obvious example, and one of Naimark's cases, is the Nazi attack on the Jews that culminated in the Holocaust. Naimark also discusses the Armenian genocide of 1915 and the expulsion of Greeks from Anatolia during the Greco-Turkish War of 1921-22; the Soviet forced deportation of the Chechens-Ingush and the Crimean Tatars in 1944; the Polish and Czechoslovak expulsion of the Germans in 1944-47; and Bosnia and Kosovo.</p><p>In this harrowing history, Naimark reveals how over and over, as racism and religious hatreds picked up an ethnic name tag, war provided a cover for violence and mayhem, an evil tapestry behind which nations acted with impunity.</p></p><p>Norman M.

Through her compelling and strange leaps and dodges, Lazic describes an identity-personal and political-informed by catastrophe and victimization that restlessly and imaginatively swerves into irreverence and often-comic absurdity. "Goodness is boring," she writes, "It seems it's hell I'm getting myself ready for." These poems careen from the poet's lament for beauty faded to her "Dorothy Parker Blues" to her searching for names among obituaries to her sexual desires without obligation, with the virtuosity that has made her one of Eastern Europe's best and most vivacious contemporary poets.</p></p><p><p><b>Radmila Lazic </b>is a noted Serbian poet, editor, and activist.

He teaches writing at the University of New Hampshire.</p>This collection of the startling, bold, assertively sexual work of one of Serbia's most prominent poets voices a theme rarely explored in literature, the desires of women in mid-life. Lazic typically relies on imagery from nature to express her explosive passion: "Every flattened rose / Is dearer to me than the erection of buds / Or the whoring bee and flower," she says in "Autumn Ode." But there is nothing romantic or bucolic about her; her language is contemporary, casual, occasionally coarse, as when she calls a younger rival "that ass-wiggling bitch." She isn't interested in marriage, only sex: "I won't share my solitude with anyone. / I came to know the bliss of departure," she says in one poem, then lists her life's pleasures: "A few lines about poetry, / My head next to someone's navel. Yes!" Lazic's stunningly unsentimental poetry will probably be unsettling to some, a welcome breath of truth to others. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Surely the Mississippi steamboat era is among the most colorful and romantic in our history. But what was it really like, beyond our secondhand notions of stalwart river pilots, wayward boys and runaway slaves, of gamblers in tall hats and ladies in hoopskirts, of cotton, cakewalks, and carpetbaggers.<br>This extraordinary book of recently discovered photographs, taken by a father and son who were professional photographers in Natchez, Mississippi, brings us for the first time a stunning array of images of steamboat life as it really was &#x2014; from its glory days in the post-Civil War era to its demise in the years immediately following World War I.<br>The photographers are Henry Norman and his son Earl. With boundless enthusiasm and curiosity, and the consummate skills of pictorial artists, they captured the beauties and rigors of a half-century of life on the Mississippi. Their priceless legacy has been preserved by Joan and Thomas Gandy, who recently acquired the extremely rare and valuable negatives and here present a collection of 170 of the most spectacular and arresting photographs of steamboat life.<br>Together with an extremely informative text, replete with detailed information and fascinating anecdotes, the photographs make up a splendid account of the major steamboats that plied the great waterway and their essential social and economic role in river life. Vivid, beautifully composed images of stately ships, luxurious interiors, shipboard life, picturesque river towns, busy landings, paddle wheelers laden with cotton and other cargoes, and the disasters that claimed so many of these proud craft, comprise a stunning firsthand account of a long-lost &#x2014; but now accurately, lovingly recaptured &#x2014; way of American life. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Between the Civil War and the turn of the century, the Mississippi River steamboat enjoyed its golden era: the boats were bigger, more elaborate and more efficient than their antebellum predecessors, and for a time they held off the railroad's challenge to their claim of being the predominant mode of transporting Deep South cotton. Here 170 pictures, taken by Natchez photographers Henry C. Norman and his son Earl, capture the period in startling clarity and freshness. There are shots of elegantly appointed dining rooms, workers posing in blackened clothes in front of furnaces, roustabouts unloading cotton and other cargo, passengers chatting leisurely on decks where spittoons were placed every six feet. The photos also capture river-town culturethe wharfs, wharehouses, saloonsand show the mystery of the Mississippi, whose erratic force sooner or later destroyed most of the boats pictured. This is a wonderful document that includes informative essays and captions. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Europe: A Natural History</h2><p><b>From internationally bestselling author and celebrated scientist Tim Flannery, a history of Europe unlike any before: an ecological account of the land itself and the forces shaping life on it.</b><br><br>In <i>Europe: A Natural History</i>, world-renowned scientist, explorer, and conservationist Tim Flannery applies the eloquent interdisciplinary approach he used in his ecological histories of Australia and North America to the story of Europe. He begins 100 million years ago, when the continents of Asia, North America, and Africa interacted to create an island archipelago that would later become the Europe we know today. It was on these ancient tropical lands that the first distinctly European organisms evolved. Flannery teaches us about Europe&#x2019;s midwife toad, which has endured since the continent&#x2019;s beginning, while elephants, crocodiles, and giant sharks have come and gone. He explores the monumental changes wrought by the devastating comet strike and shows how rapid atmospheric shifts transformed the European archipelago into a single landmass during the Eocene.<br><br>As the story moves through millions of years of evolutionary history, Flannery eventually turns to our own species, describing the immense impact humans had on the continent&#x2019;s flora and fauna&#x2015;within 30,000 years of our arrival in Europe, the woolly rhino, the cave bear, and the giant elk, among others, would disappear completely. The story continues right up to the present, as Flannery describes Europe&#x2019;s leading role in wildlife restoration, and then looks ahead to ponder the continent&#x2019;s future: with advancements in gene editing technology, European scientists are working to recreate some of the continent&#x2019;s lost creatures, such as the great ox of Europe&#x2019;s primeval forests and even the woolly mammoth.<br><br>Written with Flannery&#x2019;s characteristic combination of elegant prose and scientific expertise, <i>Europe: A Natural History</i> narrates the dramatic natural history and dynamic evolution of one of the most influential places on Earth.</p><p><b>Tim Flannery</b> is a scientist, explorer, and conservationist.

Inspired by both local traditions and modern methods, these women made art that reflected and contributed to Mexico&#x2019;s rich artistic landscape at the height of the modern period. Their work&#x2014;which included furniture design, jewelry, photography, photomurals, prints, sculpture, and textiles&#x2014;was rooted in modernism and grounded in abstraction. This constellation of like-minded practitioners shared an affinity for Mexico, a country all lived in or visited between the 1940s and the 1970s. In bringing their works together, this book offers an entirely new lens on modernism in Mexico.<br><br> Exploring the artistic culture of the country&#x2019;s postrevolutionary period, this book contains reproductions from the exhibition catalogue&#x2014;no longer in print&#x2014;that accompanied Clara Porset&#x2019;s groundbreaking 1952 exhibition in Mexico City&nbsp;<i>Art in Daily Life</i> as well as stunning illustrations of each artist&#x2019;s work.

In addition, lacking Germany's blitzkrieg approach of coordinated armor and air power, the army was organized to fight two wars: one on the ground and one in the air. Previous commentators have blamed Congressional funding and public apathy for the army's unprepared state. David E. Johnson believes instead that the principal causes were internal: army culture and bureaucracy, and their combined impact on the development of weapons and doctrine. </p><p>Johnson examines the U.S. Army's innovations for both armor and aviation between the world wars, arguing that the tank became a captive of the conservative infantry and cavalry branches, while the airplane's development was channeled by air power insurgents bent on creating an independent air force. He maintains that as a consequence, the tank's potential was hindered by the traditional arms, while air power advocates focused mainly on proving the decisiveness of strategic bombing, neglecting the mission of tactical support for ground troops. Minimal interaction between ground and air officers resulted in insufficient cooperation between armored forces and air forces. </p><p>Fast Tanks and Heavy Bombers makes a major contribution to a new understanding of both the creation of the modern U.S. Army and the Army's performance in World War II. The book also provides important insights for future military innovation.</p></p><p>"Fast Tanks and Heavy Bombers is a superbly researched and tightly argued work that chronicles the period of transformation of the United States Army from a constabulary force to the military instrument of a major world power. It forces the objective reader to reconsider the notion that America's interwar Army was purely the product of social, political, and fiscal indifference. Perhaps most importantly, it provides a poignant reminder that the destiny of the Republic in the twenty-first century will be inextricably bound up with the vision, wisdom, and professional acumen of its military leaders."--Harold R. Winton, author of To Change an Army: General Sir John Burnett-Stuart and British Armored Doctrine, 1927-1938 <p>"David Johnson has written a must read for anyone following today's Pentagon debates concerning the culture and budgets of the United States military. He has provided one of the most insightful analyses of the development of the U.S. Army and Air Force between the World Wars with a special set of lessons to be learned about how a bureaucratic military system precludes the best decisions for the good of the nation's overall national security missions."--William A.

Hilda, the older child, is both self-sacrificing and domineering, as puritanical as she is gorgeous; Eustace is a gentle, dreamy, pleasure-loving boy: the two siblings could hardly be more different, but they are also deeply devoted. And yet as Eustace and Hilda grow up and seek to go their separate ways in a world of power and position, money and love, their relationship is marked by increasing pain.<br><br>L. P. Hartley's much-loved novel, the magnum opus of one of twentieth-century England's best writers, is a complex and spellbinding work: a comedy of upper-class manners; a study in the subtlest nuances of feeling; a poignant reckoning with the ironies of character and fate. Above all, it is about two people who cannot live together or apart, about the ties that bind&#x2014;and break.</p><p>L.P.&nbsp;Hartley (1895&#x2013;1972), the son of the director of a brickworks, attended Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford, before setting out on a career as a literary critic and writer of short stories. In 1944 he published his first novel,&nbsp;<i>The Shrimp and the Anemone</i>, the opening volume of the trilogy&nbsp;<i>Eustace and Hilda</i>. In the spring of 1952, Hartley began&nbsp;<i>The Go-Between</i>, a novel strongly rooted in his childhood. By October he had already completed the first draft, and the finished product was published in early 1953.&nbsp;<i>The Go-Between</i>&nbsp;became an immediate critical and popular success and has long been considered Hartley&#x2019;s finest book.

She lives in London.The combined effect of these three books is one of mounting excellence. Eustace, the central figure, is an immortal portrayal of the delights and agonies of childhood and adolescence. I cannot but envy the author of these books. He must feel immensely satisfied to have written a social novel which is in the class of George Meredith.

With his broad back to the moonlit sky, his scruffy face was hidden beneath the shadow of a floppy hat. Chestnut hair swirled against her cheeks, and she blinked, willing the breeze to calm her nerves. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joel Sawyer arched a bushy eyebrow. "Don&#x2019;t see what&#x2019;s gotten ya so shaken up all a sudden." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lifted her chin. "I ain&#x2019;t shaken." Her eyes dared him to say otherwise. "I just don&#x2019;t see why..." She bit her tongue at the tremble in her voice. Her thumb traced the fresh bruises on her wrist&#x2014;each small dent the same size as her pa&#x2019;s fingers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because your ma&#x2019;s got a headache." Her pa&#x2019;s growl was for her ears alone. His eyes bored into hers, even through the lie. "Can&#x2019;t go lettin&#x2019; Samson down." Sour breath hit her face. "Now get on up there and sing for these people." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lonnie swallowed and eyed the crowd that had gathered for an evening of dancing. With the first autumn leaves blanketing the forest floor, it was sure to be the last of the summer. She&#x2019;d never sung for a crowd before and, at seventeen, felt foolish when her heart pounded in her ears and her skin tingled with fear. If only Samson hadn&#x2019;t asked that her ma sing this night. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pa had made it clear. No wife of his was gonna snuggle up that close to Samson Brown. Over his dead body, or so he&#x2019;d said. Lonnie watched her pa descend the steps, shoulders hunched. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry about your mama&#x2019;s headache," Samson whispered. He smiled and his eyes crinkled. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lonnie nodded, certain he knew the truth, yet fighting the urge to make a liar out of the man who&#x2019;d just deposited her at the stage as if she were no more than a pawn. <br>Lonnie glanced to the sky, and even as night&#x2019;s chill crept past her faded gingham dress, she prayed for a peace from the One who could help her through this. Her ma was the songbird. Not her. Folks were always going on about how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maggie Sawyer had the prettiest voice on any Sunday morning. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gray spotted dog tipped his ears when Lonnie stepped over him onto the makeshift stage. Her bare feet skirted around a pair of lanterns at the stage edge. Samson Brown, eyes twinkling, raised a banjo onto his lap. Lonnie took her place beside the trio&#x2019;s mandolin player, Gideon O&#x2019;Riley, and when their shoulders touched, she stepped sideways, nearly tripping as she did. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gideon glanced at her, his expression unreadable until amusement flitted through his green eyes. Lonnie chided herself for blushing so easily. The fiddler tilted his instrument to his chin. The creases in his blacksmith hands were stained dark as coal. He nodded and waited, bow poised. Reluctantly, Lonnie returned the nod. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hollow sound of his tapping boot echoed through the cracks of the porch. The bow slid across the strings slower than a cat stretching after a good, long nap. Gideon struck the strings of his mandolin, and Samson&#x2019;s banjo twanged, rambling as free as a holler. Lonnie watched in awe, bewildered by their confidence. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She clung to the shadows from the eaves overhead, but when her pa motioned for her to step into the moonlight, she scooted forward. Her bare toes reached the edge of the porch, and she glanced away from her pa&#x2019;s smug stare. When the fiddle&#x2019;s strings thickened in harmonies, Lonnie sang out the words. Her heart quickened, stunned by the sound of her own voice belting out a song she&#x2019;d learned at her ma&#x2019;s knee. She stared into the blur of faces as feet stomped and calico skirts swirled, revealing dozens of homemade petticoats and faded stockings. She forced her foot to tap in rhythm as men spun their girls around. Those without girls jigged up enough dust to make a body need a good bath. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About to round into the third verse, the words snagged in her throat. She blinked, her mind suddenly blank. Lonnie, you know this! With his shoulders hunched, Gideon&#x2019;s hands flew over the fret board, and the fiddler played louder than ever. After clearing her throat, Lonnie readied herself for the last verse. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gideon sped up, leaving the rest of the band behind. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the crowd bellowed and cheered, Lonnie bit her lip. Gideon played faster, an impish grin lighting his face. She clapped trembling hands and glanced to the musician beside her. Shaking his head, Samson rose slowly from his chair and, still plucking the strings of his banjo, crossed the porch. He flashed a twisted smile. <br>Cheers swarmed from the crowd. With slow movements, Samson reached out his boot and kicked Gideon&#x2019;s stool so hard it flew out from under him. Gideon stumbled but did not fall. His hand fell from the fret board, and after throwing a glare at Samson, he grabbed the stool and sat. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C&#x2019;mon, Gid! Lighten up a bit, would ya?" Samson yelled over the noise. <br>Gideon rushed in with a few last strums until only his vibrations remained, bouncing through the woods. Folks whistled and cheered so loudly Lonnie could no longer hear the pounding of her heart. Clapping along, she stepped back. Never again would her pa talk her into singing in front of folks. No sir. Her place was in the back of the crowd. <br>Gideon held his mandolin over his head and bowed. As cocky as he was, Lonnie couldn&#x2019;t help but smile. He walked toward her and, without hesitation, draped an arm over her shoulders. He smelled of smoke and cedar. Heat grew in the back of her neck and tingled into her cheeks. She needn&#x2019;t look down to see the flame in her pa&#x2019;s face as well&#x2014; she knew it was there. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the applause mellowed, she slid away and scurried down the steps, her legs weak and head light with relief. She brushed past a nuzzling couple and ducked under a thick arm that clutched a pint of cider, finally spotting her aunt Sarah beneath a scarlet maple. Enough moonlight danced through the leaves to make the woman&#x2019;s ginger bun shine. Rushing over, Lonnie clasped her cool hands, the rough skin worn and familiar. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, you&#x2019;re tremblin&#x2019; som&#x2019;n awful." Sarah squeezed her hand. "Don&#x2019;t think for one moment you don&#x2019;t belong up there. You&#x2019;da made your ma proud."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonnie fought to catch her breath. "That was the most terrifying thing I&#x2019;ve ever done in my life." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt a shadow behind her. Lonnie didn&#x2019;t need to glance over her shoulder when rough fingertips clutched her elbow. "We&#x2019;ll be leaving now." Her pa&#x2019;s voice was gruff. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She glanced at her aunt, then peered up at him. "Mind if I stay a bit longer?"&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes flinched, but then he sighed. The smell of moonshine hung thick. "Walk home with Oliver. He&#x2019;s stayin&#x2019; too." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yessir. Thank you, Pa." Her words seemed to fall on nothing but the breeze as he strode from the clearing. Lonnie knew her ma would be up waiting, the littlest ones already tucked into bed. With a sigh, she let the last of her worry melt into the cool night air and turned to her aunt, pleased to have her company for at least a little while longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So..." Sarah&#x2019;s whimsical voice nearly sang the single word. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don&#x2019;t say it." Lonnie wagged a finger with little authority, knowing full well what her aunt was itching to say. Sarah sobered, the lines around her eyes smoothing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lonnie knew her mother&#x2019;s sister well. "I blush too easily," she blurted. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A smile lifted her aunt&#x2019;s round cheeks. Twice Lonnie&#x2019;s age and with skin a shade paler, she was as dear a friend as Lonnie had ever had. When Sarah&#x2019;s gaze moved past her, Lonnie tossed a glance over her shoulder and saw the blacksmith run a cloth over his fiddle. Samson lowered his banjo into a sack. Gideon had moved on. His shoulder was pressed to the bark of a hundred-year-old chestnut, and his arms lay folded over his chest. The girl he was wooing looked more than willing to have his undivided attention. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seems like every girl in Rocky Knob wants to steal that boy&#x2019;s heart." Sarah shook her head. "Don&#x2019;t you pay it no never mind." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forcing a shrug, Lonnie tugged at a pinch of her faded dress. The fabric, different shades of blue, had seen better days. She suddenly wished she hadn&#x2019;t been so eager to stay behind.</p><h2>Taunton&#39;s Complete Illustrated Guide to Using Woodworking Tools</h2><p><p>This step-by-step pictorial reference, <em><strong>Taunton's Complete Illustrated Guide to Using Woodworking Tools</strong></em>, covers using all the tools found in a modern woodworking shop.

Confronting this emotionally charged question, Ladelle McWhorter reveals how a carefully structured campaign against abnormality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries encouraged white Americans to purge society of so-called biological contaminants, people who were poor, disabled, black, or queer. Building on a legacy of savage hate crimes&#x2015;such as the killings of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd&#x2015;McWhorter shows that racism, sexual oppression, and discrimination against the disabled, the feeble, and the poor are all aspects of the same societal distemper, and that when the civil rights of one group are challenged, so are the rights of all.</p></p><p><p>Ladelle McWhorter is the James Thomas Professor of Philosophy and Professor of the Women's, Gender, and Sexualities Studies Program at the University of Richmond. She is author of Bodies and Pleasures: Foucault and the Politics of Sexual Normalization (IUP, 1999).</p>[This book] is a powerful fact-based philosophical epic of oppression in Anglo-America along its two central axes&#x2015;racism and sexuality.Vol. 23.4 2009 (Cynthia Willett <i>Emory University</i>)<br><br>McWhorter's expanded conception of racism is a path-breaking and far-reaching contribution to critical race theory, disability theory, queer theory, and Foucault scholarship that complicates some of the most accepted understandings of these fields and shows how these understandings have at different times, in unexpected ways, enhanced relations of subjection, domination, and control. (<i>Hypatia</i>)<br><br>. . . an important book on the study of race and sexuality studies. . . . By using definition, theory, and discussion of 'normality' and 'abnormality' as put forth by Foucault, McWhorter is able to highlight issues of sexual discrimination within the Anglo-American world.

He was raised by the Kin&#x2014;Abel, Aklia, Seth, and Luluwa&#x2014;gentle, dark-brown machines that nurtured him from infant to child, child to adolescent. They looked like him in shape but were made from a different material. He had grown in their quiet, attentive care, knowing he was not the same but never dreaming that he was a monster. There were no monsters in his world, deep under the stables in the old city of Essenwald.<br><br>Essenwald was a European city, imported piece by piece to the Dark Continent and reassembled in a vast clearing made in the perimeter of the forest. It was built over a century and a half, the core of its imitation now so old that it had become genuine, while the extremes of weather had set about another form of fakery, forcing the actions of seasons through the high velocity of tropical tantrum. Many of the old stone houses had been shipped in, each brick numbered for resurrection. Some of the newer mansions and warehouses had taken local materials and copied the ornate, crumbling splendour of their predecessors, adding original artistic brilliance in their skeuomorphic vision of decay. It was prosperous, busy, and full of movement, with solid roads and train lines scrolling out from its frantic, lustrous heart. Only one track crawled into the dark interior of the forest. Into the eternal mass of the Vorrh.<br><br>For years, it was said that nobody had ever reached the centre of the Vorrh. Or, if they had, then they had never returned. Business expanded and flourished on its southernmost outskirts, but nothing was known of its interior, except myth and fear. It was the mother of forests; ancient beyond language, older than every known species, and, some said, propagator of them all, locked in its own system of evolution and climate.<br><br>The banded foliage and vast trees that breathed its rich air offered much to humans but could also devour a thousand of their little lives in a microsecond of their uninterrupted, unfathomable time. So vast was its acreage, it also made its demands of time, splitting the toiling sun into zones outside of normal calibration; a theoretical traveller, passing through its entire breadth on foot, would have to stop at its centre and wait at least a week for his soul to catch up. So dense was its breathing, it dented the surrounding climate. Swirling clouds interacted with its shadow. Its massive transpiration sucked at the nearby city that fed from it, sipping from the lungs of its inhabitants and filling the skies with oxygen. It brought in storms and unparalleled shifts of weather. Sometimes it mimicked Europe, smuggling a fake winter for a week or two, dropping temperatures and making the city look and feel like its progenitor. Then it spun winds and heat to make the masonry crack after the tightness of the impossible frost.<br><br>No planes dared fly over it. Its unpredictable climate, dizzying abnormalities of compass, and impossibilities of landing made it a pilot&#x2019;s and navigator&#x2019;s nightmare. All its pathways turned into overgrowth, jungle, and ambush. The tribes that were rumoured to live there were barely human&#x2014;some said the anthropophagi still roamed. Creatures beyond hope. Heads growing below their shoulders. Horrors.<br><br>The logging roads skirted its perimeter, allowing commerce to gingerly nibble at its unprotected edges. There were no commercial means of ingress or egress from its solid shadow, except for the train. The mindlessly straight track that ran towards its heart was laid, line by line, with the hunger for wood. As it grew forwards, it forgot its immediate past. The iron rail carried sleep in its miles of repetition.<br><br>Most of the train that ran on it was composed of open platform and iron chain, built to receive the freshly cut trunks. But there were two passenger carriages, made for short and necessary visits or for those whose curiosity outstripped their wisdom. There were also the slave carriers, basic boxes on wheels designed to carry the workforce into the forest&#x2019;s interior. The slaves had changed before the eyes of their owners. They had transformed into other beings, beings devoid of purpose, identity, or meaning. In the beginning, it was thought their malaise was the product of their imprisonment, but it soon became clear there was no personality left to feel or suffer such subtleties of emotion. The forest itself had devoured their memory and resurrected them as addicts.<br><br>The city of Essenwald fed on the trees, consuming the myriad of different species that ferociously grew there. Sawmills and lumberyards buzzed and sang in the daylight hours, rubber works cooked sap into objects, and paper mills boiled and bleached the bodies naked, ready for words. All this appetite was allowed by the forest. It encouraged the nibbling at one of its edges and used it as another form of protection&#x2014;a minor one in comparison to the arsenal of defence that kept the Vorrh eternal.<br><br>Essenwald&#x2019;s declaration of power and continuance was written throughout the twisting streets, like a labyrinthine manuscript. One such crooked causeway was called K�hler Brunnen, its handwritten name nailed high on its sunless side. A house of significant age stood at its middle; its core was among the first to arrive and be sunken into the heated ground, on the site of a more sacred enclosure that some said was older than humanity itself. Parts of its later exterior had been copied in anthracite-rich stone, mined from a long-extinct quarry. Its proportion and whereabouts were stolen from one of the bitter-clad cities of northern Saxony. Its windows were shuttered. It quietly brooded, while deflecting any attention. Its small, neat stables contained three horses, a polished carriage, and a working cart. Cobbles and straw gave movement and scent to its courtyard&#x2019;s stillness, while far below, beneath the blue and yellow, the brown ones hummed and fussed over the white thing they grew. The air was filled with their scent of ozone and phenol and the slight singeing of their overly warm bodies, an odour of life that led to cracking and brittleness, emitting its own distinctive hum, in the same way we age with wrinkles and softening.<br><br>Four K�hler Brunnen wanted to be empty. The house thought it had completed its business with full-time occupancy many years before.<br><br>Yet while the house contained no people in the poised hollowness of its rooms above ground, in its basement was a well of astonishing depth&#x2014;if it were ever given sky, it would reflect the most distant galaxies in its sightless water. The old, dark house was always alert and guarding what occurred beneath it.<br><br>There, under 4 K�hler Brunnen, among the crated machines and stagnant presses, boxed carboys and empty, stained vessels, Ishmael was becoming a man. His docile white body was beginning to toughen and shape itself for a different purpose, though it would never be as hard as the Kin. He was made of flesh, like the animals, and they were made of Bakelite, like the furniture. Their bodies were perfect in their gleam and the depth of their polished surfaces. Each was a unique, beautiful variation of form and appointment&#x2014;he forever marvelled at their splendour, while examining the flabby imprecision of his own shell.<br><br>Over time, he had become more and more intrigued by Luluwa; she was unlike the others. Not because she was female. That had been explained to him before. There were four kinds of things like him in this world: men, women, animals, and ghosts. He was a man, like Abel and Seth. Luluwa was a woman, like Aklia. He was just a different kind. Men had tubes and strength, women had pouches and gentleness. He had a little of all.<br>He had first felt heat for Luluwa when she killed an animal for him. Snapping it in her long, shiny fingers, she had opened it for him to taste and smell and had explained that its insides were a copy of his, made in the same materials, unlike her own, which were modelled from a different substance. She had described how the thick, soft covering kept the animal warm, and that in time, he, too, would have such, and that if he looked carefully near the lamp he might see tiny traces of growth already there on his pliant skin. She had extended her smooth, graceful arm and shown him the absence of &#x201c;hair.&#x201d; He had flushed, felt ashamed and badly made. He&#x2019;d wanted to hold his breath and suck all the traces of animal back into his shell, wanted every hair to shrivel and glaze over, towards her perfection.<br><br>She had explained before that he was too soft to grow, to expand from the inside out, to puff up. She was fully formed and inflexible. This made no sense to him&#x2014;why would he have to grow into something while she was already there, immaculate? She tapped her brown shell and said that her skin was stiff and brittle while his was pliant and cuttable, that they were both vulnerable in different ways.<br><br>She touched the back of his neck, stroking him with two perfect fingers, reassuring him of his place, his distinction, and her affectionate acceptance. The solidity and coolness of her touch excited him and tightened his lukewarm softness into tumescent mimicry. She pretended not to notice and drifted away from his shock on a wave of ductile clicks and internal hisses, sounds he would remember throughout his tangled life.<br><br>He lifted his gaze from his awkward lap to watch her move across the long room. Her walk was purposeful, smooth, and exact, as if each of the hundreds of minor adjustments needed for propulsion and balance was consciously thought about, carefully considered in fractions of time that were impossible to contemplate. He knew if he thought about walking like that, he would fall after a few steps. Such perfect control was unattainable to his jarring and ridiculous motion. Luluwa was graceful and constant, while he was becoming more and more clumsy and random. Surges of emotion and eruptions of ideas tossed his motley, leaking being in unpredictable tides, causing him to invent doubt as a companion, to construct anxiety as a mirror in opposition to flawlessness, knowing that only he would be seen in it and that the others would quietly continue without reflection.<br><br>Sometimes, when he watched them sleeping, becoming charged, he became fascinated by their stillness. He would sit very close to Luluwa and one of the others and watch for movement. Once, Seth, who was standing behind him, asked why he was looking so closely.<br><br>&#x201c;Because I think they are dead,&#x201d; he said, without a moment&#x2019;s thought. Seth put his hand on the boy&#x2019;s shoulder and made a rotational sound in his throat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like the animals when they are broken,&#x201d; the boy said over his shoulder, without taking his eye off the sleeping woman. &#x201c;Before they break they are entirely made of movement, and then it stops. Where does the movement go?&#x201d;<br><br>Seth moved to the boy&#x2019;s side and knelt, looking with him. &#x201c;It is true that all living things move and the movement is unceasing. It is also true that the dead do not move. But sometimes the movement is concealed in smallness and hides from sight. I will show you.&#x201d;<br><br>Ishmael broke his stare to watch Seth speaking, looking at the words unfold from his toothless mouth, focusing on the shudder flap dancing in his jaws.<br><br>He slid away to a cabinet across the room and opened a drawer. He returned with quick purpose, carrying a glass tube as long as his arm and a small glass funnel. Kneeling again, this time between Luluwa and the boy, he rested one end of the tube on the sleeper&#x2019;s brow and attached the funnel to the other end. He put his finger to his lips, hissed, and winked. The boy understood the agreement and they moved stealthily, so as not to awaken her. Seth put the cupped end of the funnel to the boy&#x2019;s ear, delicately placing the other end in the corner of the sleeper&#x2019;s closed eye. He froze there, half-turning to watch the listener&#x2019;s face.<br><br>At first Ishmael could hear nothing but his own agitation. Then, in the tube, he heard a diminutive sound. Yes, and again, a fluid hiss, like the sound of spit in one&#x2019;s mouth, so faint that it could have been from the other side of the universe. Yes! There again&#x2014;irregular but fast and flickering, a whisper of pulse. He stopped and took his ear away from the tube.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it, that noise?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Seth became intent and modestly smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s her eye moving,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Beneath the hard lid.&#x201d; He stared deep into the boy. &#x201c;She is dreaming.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Sigmund Mutter, a trained, tight-lipped servant, would visit 4 K�hler Brunnen every Sunday to mechanically attend to its upkeep. After finishing his duties that day, he turned the key in the heavy lock, which jarred against its closure, causing him to totter in the street. A tarry, wet cigar, chewed into the corner of his badly shaved mouth, accentuated his shallow breath in the cold air. He was returning home to the rich, swollen musk of his wife&#x2019;s lunch, and his attention was slurred between last night&#x2019;s schnapps and the saturated sleep that wallowed on the other side of the thick food of the afternoon; perhaps that is why the lock wasn&#x2019;t quite properly engaged and he fumbled the keys, dropping them into the icy mire.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Sigmund,&#x201d; fluttered a voice above his mittened stooping. He groaned himself into an upright attention to respond to the shining woman smiling over his moleskin hump. There stood Ghertrude Eloise Tulp. Her height was accentuated by the full-length beige winter coat that glowed around her, her radiance framed by a brightly patterned scarf, which held a wide-brimmed hat over stacked curls of auburn hair. Her green eyes shone with a strength that was uncomfortable.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Mistress Tulp; a fine, cold day.&#x201d;<br><br>For a moment they were suspended between gestures. The street became narrow as it rose, funnelling from a broad hip for carriages into a stilted neck of roofs, the chimneys crooked and attempting to mimic the calligraphy of trees, burnt black against the madder sky. High in the nape of the street was a clock, unworking and roughly painted out, an act of erasure that had no story. Like its blind face, the meeting below seemed equally gagged.<br><br>&#x201c;How is Deacon Tulp?&#x201d; Mutter blurted out, with a barked volume that disclosed his need for departure.<br><br>&#x201c;My father is well,&#x201d; she said kindly, knowing that she could play with this stupid man&#x2019;s inferiority. A fierce gust of wind wrestled in from the cathedral square and paused her calculated sport, agitating the heavy door just enough for her to see that it was unlocked.<br><br>&#x201c;Do give my regards and affection to your wife and the little ones,&#x201d; she piped. He blinked clumsily at her, not quite believing the ease of his escape. &#x201c;And do tell her not to worry about the lateness of the rent; my father understands that things are hard at this time of year.&#x201d;<br><br>This sent him scurrying away, stuttering his beaten hat against his flaky head with felicitation for all of her kin. She was left in the empty, windblown street with her excitement distinctly rattling in the mouth of the half-open lock.<br><br>Mutter&#x2019;s main task was looking after the house and the horses, beasts that he and his family had the use of when not ferrying crates from locations across the city to the cellars below and vice versa.<br><br>Each week he collected a numbered crate from a warehouse an hour&#x2019;s drive away, brought it to the house, and exchanged it for the previous week&#x2019;s used one. He had no idea what was inside the beautifully made, simple wooden boxes, and he did not care. Such was his temperament; it was fiercely consistent, as it had been with his father and hopefully would be with his sons.

In so doing, he comes to terms with many theological and cultural issues raised by modernity. Although the Eucharist is the center of focus, other issues in Christian faith are also examined, such as the Christian understanding of God, Creation, the Incarnation, Redemption, and biblical Revelation. <br><br>Sokolowski employs a method that he calls "the theology of disclosure," which studies the structures of appearance and should be distinguished from both positive and scholastic theology. He takes appearances as objective disclosures, not as mere psychological events. When discussing the Eucharist, he shows how it uses the form of quotation and how it draws on various temporal dimensions of human existence as it reenacts the sacrifice of Christ before the eternal Father. <br><br>The author also considers how Christian belief differs from other forms of religion and from modern atheism. By demonstrating how the Christian understanding of God differs from other ways of understanding the divine, he attempts to show that Christianity is not simply one religion among many but the truth of religion. <br><br>These deeper themes are explored as necessary contexts for the Eucharist, which could not be properly understood except against the background of the Christian understanding of God as eternal and as Creator and Redeemer. The author provides a comprehensive theological treatment of major issues in Christian faith and does so with categories that are appropriate to our present intellectual and cultural world. <br><br>This study, which draws upon the work of many classical and contemporary theologians, especially Hans Urs von Balthasar, contributes significantly to speculative theology and to Eucharistic studies. It will be of great use to theologians and philosophers, as well as to students of Christian philosophy and sacramental theology. <br><br>Robert Sokolowski, a priest of the Archdiocese of Hartford, has taught philosophy at The Catholic University of America since 1963. He has written six books and numerous articles dealing with phenomenology, philosophy and Christian faith, moral philosophy, and issues in contemporary science. He has been an auxiliary chaplain at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., since 1976 and was named monsignor in 1993.<p></p><br><p></p><br>&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;<br><br>"Indispensable for graduate and divinity programs with interests in Catholic theology and phenomenology of religions.&#x2015;<i>Religious Studies Review</i><br><br>"Intellectually stimulating. . . .

Widening inequality and the loss of jobs to trade and technology has left a significant portion of the American workforce disenfranchised and skeptical of governments and corporations alike. And yet both have a role to play in improving the country for all.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sawhill argues for a policy agenda based on mainstream values, such as family, education, and work. Although many have lost faith in government programs designed to help them, there are still trusted institutions on both the local and the federal level that can deliver better job opportunities and higher wages to those who have been left behind. At the same time, the private sector needs to reexamine how it trains and rewards employees. This book provides a clear-headed and middle-way path to a better-functioning society in which personal responsibility is honored and inclusive capitalism and more broadly shared growth are once more the norm.</p><p><b>Isabel V.

He was born on November 7, 1916, in Greenville, Mississippi, and attended school there until he entered the University of North Carolina. During World War II he served as a captain of field artillery but never saw combat. After World War II he worked briefly for the Associated Press in their New York bureau. In 1953 he moved to Memphis, where he lived for the remainder of his life.Foote was the author of six novels:&nbsp;<i>Tournament</i>,&nbsp;<i>Follow Me Down</i>,&nbsp;<i>Love in a Dry Season</i>,&nbsp;<i>Shiloh</i>,&nbsp;<i>Jordan County, </i>and&nbsp;<i>September, September</i>. He is best remembered for his 3-volume history&nbsp;<i>The Civil War: A Narrative</i>, which took twenty years to complete and resulted in his being a featured expert in Ken Burns' acclaimed PBS documentary,<i> The Civil War</i>. Over the course of his writing career, Foote was also awarded three Guggenheim fellowships.Shelby Foote died in 2005 at the age of 88.Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> In the summer of 1862, following McClellan&#x2019;s mauled retreatfrom the gates of Richmond, James Russell Lowell&#x2019;s reply to his editor&#x2019;s request for a poem was that he was &#x201c;clear down to the bottom of the well, where I see the Truth too near to make verses of.&#x201d; Similarly, Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2014;saluted by Lincoln in person as &#x201c;the little lady who started this big war&#x201d;&#x2014;responded, when asked why she had not written a wartime sequel to Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin: &#x201c;Who could write fiction when life was so imperious and terrible?&#x201d; Nathaniel Hawthorne, on the other hand, felt &#x201c;mentally and physically languid&#x201d; under pressure from the conflict, and though he died while Grant was outmaneuvering Lee down in Virginia, just short of a year before the finish, he did manage to produce an essay titled &#x201c;Chiefly About War Matters&#x201d; in which he confessed that &#x201c;the Present, the Immediate, the Actual, has proved too potent for me. It takes away not only my scanty faculty, but even my desire for imaginative composition, and leaves me sadly content to scatter a thousand peaceful fantasies upon the hurricane that is sweeping us all along with it, possibly, into a Limbo where our nation and its polity may be as literally the fragments of a scattered dream as my unwritten Romance.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nor did the end of the war provide any sudden correction of this blockage. Two years after Appomattox, William Dean Howells&#x2014;assistant editor of the Atlantic Monthly at thirty, soon to be editor-in-chief, and for the next forty years the acknowledged dean of American letters&#x2014;declared that the war &#x201c;has laid upon our literature a charge under which it has staggered very lamely.&#x201d; Crane&#x2019;s The Red Badge of Courage, published a generation later in 1895, was the exception that proved the rule; the sluice gate opened only to close again. Indeed, Howell&#x2019;s complaint is nearly as valid today as it was when he made it, just over 125 years ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this country, historical fiction has in general been left to second-raters and hired brains, and this is particularly true of those who have chosen the Civil War as a major subject. Aside from Crane, our best fiction writers have given it mere incidental attention or none at all. Hemingway is a case in point; so is Henry James. This is regrettable on several counts, especially to those who would understand our nation by learning just what happened during that blood-drenched era&#x2014;good and bad things, both in abundance&#x2014;to make us what we are. Facts we have had and are having in ever greater numbers, perhaps a glut, through the years leading up to and away from the Sumter centennial, when biographies, overall explications, and brochures came pouring in a torrent from the presses and binderies. Yet there is a multifaceted truth outside the facts&#x2014;beyond them, so to speak, or hidden inside them&#x2014;and of this we have had all too little, because in this respect our novelists have let us down. &#x201c;I would rather have The Iliad,&#x201d; a recent translator of Homer has said, &#x201c;than a whole shelf of Bronze Age war reports.&#x201d; So too, no doubt, would we; but there is no American Iliad, John Brown&#x2019;s Body notwithstanding.<br> &nbsp;<br> This collection is an attempt, on a small scale, to examine what has been done to lessen the gap our best creative writers left unfilled in dealing with the four-year segment of history connecting Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s Provisional Inaugural at Montgomery in mid-February of 1861 and Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s Second Inaugural at Washington in early March of 1865. Scarcity made the task of selection difficult in one sense and easy in another. As it turned out&#x2014;Ambrose Bierce being the earliest author represented&#x2014;the writing span was reduced to the near-seventy years (1891-1960) that fell between Tales of Soldiers and Civilians and John O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s Ourselves to Know, from which I snipped the single page I sometimes think is perhaps the best single page in the whole collection.<br> &nbsp;<br> However that may be, the test for inclusion applied in each case was neither the subject nor the event described, no matter how desirable or attractive from a historical point of view, but rather the quality of the writing itself&#x2014;a criterion that cost me the northern realist John W. De Forest, along with the southern romanticist John Esten Cooke, as well as a good many others on both sides. Only this, it seems to me&#x2014;the way and tone of the telling&#x2014;can make a story memorable or true in the real sense. The Monitor-Merrimac duel in Hampton Roads, the headlong charge up Missionary Ridge, the death of Pat Cleburne at Franklin, Grant in his rumpled clothes at Appomattox: these and a host of other occurrences, worthy as they are in their own right, are not here because I could not find them measured up to, or even approximated, in the writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> What we have in their stead is a series of events totally unlike the ones mentioned above: a coachload of whores on a siding during a great battle in Virginia, an old man remembering his particular corner of a bloody field in Georgia, a pioneer being suffocated in the backwash of war in the Mississippi delta, a young slave girl wading into the Big Black River with the gathered bones of the child she bore her dead master&#x2019;s missing son, a gallant Confederate lieutenant losing the seat of his trousers as he rescues a fair damsel from the wreckage of an outhouse, a spy&#x2019;s thoughts as his Union captors break his neck below a bridge in Alabama, the baleful welcome-home of a pair of shattered Pennsylvania veterans, a New York farm boy looking forward to the test of combat and then running when it comes, and Mark Twain on the eve of his skedaddle. (The one exception is Ben�t&#x2019;s panoramic view of Fish-Hook Gettysburg; but I had to go to epic poetry to find it.)<br> &nbsp;<br> These are what remain after the winnowing: a sorry-enough array, on the face of it, out of an era that is supposed to have been, and in large part was, wildly romantic. Yet, such is the power and glory of art, by transmutation they are no less noble, even as events, than the ones that had to be left out because good writers failed to take them up. Of the ten authors represented in these pages, half are Northern, half are Southern, and if any bias favoring the latter is suspected or detected, I can promise you&#x2019;ll find precious little moonlight and no magnolias at all. As for the inclusion of a story by the compiler, I can only say that, for one thing, I rather think it belongs here, and for another&#x2014;which gladdened the heart of the publisher&#x2014;it was free.<br> &nbsp;<br> Otherwise no apology is called for, as anyone who reads ahead will see. Even the incidental attention of writers like Fitzgerald and Wolfe produces for us an insight we otherwise would lack. The hookers on the day coach, the old man looking back through time to Chickamauga: these show us dimensions of that tragic confrontation we might never have known if something had not drawn these two writers&#x2019; attention, even incidentally. And if selections predominate toward the near end of that seven-decade span, this too can be taken not only as a sign that, in one regard at least, American writing has improved in the main with age, but also as an indication, or in any case grounds for hope, that the best is yet to come.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Provisional Inaugural<br> &nbsp;<br> JEFFERSON DAVIS<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Montgomery, Alabama<br> February 18, 1861<br> &nbsp;<br> Friends and Fellow-Citizens: Our present political position has been achieved in a manner unprecedented in the history of nations. It illustrates the American idea that government rests on the consent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish them at will whenever they become destructive of the ends for which they were established. The declared purpose of the compact of the Union from which we have withdrawn was to &#x201c;establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity&#x201d;; and when, in the judgment of the sovereign States composing this Confederacy, it has been perverted from the purposes for which it was ordained, and ceased to answer the ends for which it was established, a peaceful appeal to the ballot-box declared that, so far as they are concerned, the Government created by that compact should cease to exist.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this they merely asserted the right which the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776 defined to be &#x201c;inalienable.&#x201d; Of the time and occasion of its exercise they as sovereigns were the final judges, each for itself. The impartial and enlightened verdict of mankind will vindicate the rectitude of our conduct; and He who knows the hearts of men will judge of the sincerity with which we have labored to preserve the Government of our fathers in its spirit.<br> &nbsp;<br> An agricultural people, whose chief interest is the export of commodities required in every manufacturing country, our true policy is peace, and the freest trade which our necessities will permit. It is alike our interest and that of all those to whom we would sell, and from whom we would buy, that there should be the fewest practicable restrictions upon the interchange of these commodities. There can, however, be but little rivalry between ours and any manufacturing or navigating community, such as the Northeastern States of the American Union. It must follow, therefore, that mutual interest will invite to good-will and kind offices on both parts. If, however, passion or lust of dominion should cloud the judgment or inflame the ambition of those States, we must prepare to meet the emergency and maintain, by the final arbitrament of the sword, the position which we have assumed among the nations of the earth.<br> &nbsp;<br> We have entered upon the career of independence, and it must be inflexibly pursued. Through many years of controversy with our late associates of the Northern States, we have vainly endeavored to secure tranquillity and obtain respect for the rights to which we were entitled. As a necessity, not a choice, we have resorted to the remedy of separation, and henceforth our energies must be directed to the conduct of our own affairs, and the perpetuity of the Confederacy which we have formed. If a just perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably to pursue our separate political career, my most earnest desire will have been fulfilled. But if this be denied to us, and the integrity of our territory and jurisdiction be assailed, it will but remain for us with firm resolve to appeal to arms and invoke the blessing of Providence on a just cause.<br> &nbsp;<br> Should reason guide the action of the Government from which we have separated, a policy so detrimental to the civilized world, the Northern States included, could not be dictated by even the strongest desire to inflict injury upon us; but, if the contrary should prove true, a terrible responsibility will rest upon it, and the suffering of millions will bear testimony to the folly and wickedness of our aggressors.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is joyous in the midst of perilous times to look around upon a people united in heart, where one purpose of high resolve animates and actuates the whole; where the sacrifices to be made are not weighed in the balance against honor and right and liberty and equality. Obstacles may retard, but they cannot long prevent, the progress of a movement sanctified by its justice and sustained by a virtuous people. Reverently let us invoke the God of our Fathers to guide and protect us in our efforts to perpetuate the principles which by His blessing they were able to vindicate, establish, and transmit to their posterity. With the continuance of His favor ever gratefully acknowledged, we may hopefully look forward to success, to peace, and to prosperity.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Reawakened</h2><p>Once Upon a Time Tale Reawakened</p><p></p><h2>In the Dark: A Novel (A DI Adam Fawley Novel)</h2><p><b>From internationally bestselling author Cara Hunter, a riveting suspense novel about the shocking secrets revealed when a woman is discovered held captive behind a basement wall&#x2014;and no one is who they appear to be</b><br><br> <i>Do you know what they&#x2019;re hiding in the house next door?</i><br><br> A woman and child are found locked in a basement, barely alive, and unidentifiable: the woman can&#x2019;t speak, there are no missing persons reports that match their profile, and the confused, elderly man who owns the house claims he has never seen them before. The inhabitants of the quiet street are in shock&#x2014;how could this happen right under their noses? But Detective Inspector Adam Fawley knows nothing is impossible. And no one is as innocent as they seem.<br><br> As the police grow desperate for a lead, Fawley stumbles across a breakthrough, a link to a case he worked years before about another young woman and child gone missing, never solved. When he realizes the missing woman&#x2019;s house is directly adjacent to the house in this case, he thinks he might have found the connection that could bring justice for both women. But there&#x2019;s something not quite right about the little boy from the basement, and the truth will send shockwaves through the force that Fawley never could have anticipated.<br><br> A deeply unsettling, heart-stopping mystery of long-buried secrets and the monsters who hide in plain sight, <i>In the Dark</i> is the second gripping novel featuring DI Adam Fawley.</p><p><b>Cara Hunter</b> lives and works in Oxford. She also studied for a degree and PhD in English literature at Oxford University.Prologue<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She opens her eyes to darkness as close as a blindfold. To the heaviness of old dank air that hasn&#x2019;t been breathed for a long time.<br><br> Her other senses lurch awake. The dripping silence, the cold, the smell. Mildew and something else she can&#x2019;t yet place, something animal and fetid. She moves her fingers, feeling grit and wet under her jeans. It&#x2019;s coming back to her now &#x2013; how she got here, why this happened.<br> <i>How could she have been so stupid.<br>&nbsp;</i><br> She stifles the acid rush of panic and tries to sit up, but the movement defeats her. She fills her lungs and shouts, fling- ing echoes against the walls. Shouts and shouts and shouts until her throat is raw.<br><br> But no one comes. Because no one can hear.<br><br> She closes her eyes again, feeling hot angry tears seeping down her face. She is rigid with outrage and recrimination and conscious of little else until, in terror, she feels the first sharp little feet start to move across her skin.<br><br><p>Someone said, didn't they, that April is the cruellest month. Well, whoever it was, they weren't a detective. Cruelty can happen any time - I know, I've seen it. But the cold and the dark somehow dull the edge. Sunlight and birdsong and blue skies can be brutal in this job. Perhaps it's the contrast that does it. Death and hope.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This story starts with hope. May 1st; the first day of spring - real spring. And if you've ever been to Oxford, you'll know: it's all or nothing in this place - when it rains the stone is piss-coloured, but in the light, when the colleges look like they've been carved from cloud, there is no more beautiful place on earth. And I'm just a cynical old copper.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for May Morning, well, that's the city at its most eccentric, its most defiantly 'itself'. Pagan and Christian and a bit mad, and it's hard to tell, a lot of the time, which is which. Choirboys singing in the sunrise on the top of a tower. Hurdy-gurdy bands jostling the all-night burger vans. The pubs open at 6 a.m., and half the student population is still pissed from the night before. Even the sober citizens of North Oxford turn out en masse with flowers in their hair (and you think I'm joking). There were over 25,000 people there last year. One of them was a bloke dressed as a tree. I think you get the picture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, one way or another it's a big day in the police calendar. But it's a long straw on the uniform roster, not a short one. The early start can be a bit of a killer, but there's rarely any trouble, and we get plied with coffee and bacon sandwiches. Or at least we were, the last time I did it. But that was when I was still in uniform. Before I became a detective; before I made DI.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But this year, it's different. This year, it's not just the early start that's the killer.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* * *<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By the time Mark Sexton reaches the house he's nearly an hour late. It should have been a clear run at that time of the morning but the traffic on the M40 was nose to tail, and the queue backed up all the way down the Banbury Road. And when he turns into Frampton Road there's a builder's truck blocking his drive. Sexton curses, slams the Cayenne into reverse and screeches backwards. Then he flings the car door open and steps out on to the street, narrowly missing a splatter of sick on the tarmac. He looks down in distaste, checking his shoes. What is it with this bloody city this morning? He locks the car, strides up to the front door, then digs into his pockets, looking for his keys. At least the scaffolding's gone up now. The sale took far longer than expected, but it should still be done by Christmas, if they're lucky. He lost out on an auction for a place on the far side of the Woodstock Road, and had to up his bid to get this one, but by the time he's finished, it'll be a bloody gold mine. The rest of the housing market might be treading water, but what with the Chinese and the Russians, prices just never seem to go down in this city. Only an hour from London and a top-notch private school for the boys only three streets away. His wife didn't like the idea of semi-detached but he told her, just look at it - it's bloody enormous. Genuine Victorian, four storeys above ground and a basement he plans to fit out as a state-of-the-art wine cellar and home cinema complex (not that he's told his wife that yet). And only some old git living next door - he's not going to be having many all-night parties, now is he. And yes, his garden is a bit of a state, but they can always stick up some trellis. The landscape designer said something about pleached trees. A grand a pop but it's instant cover. Though even that won't solve the problem out the front. He glances across at the rusting Cortina propped up on bricks outside number 33 and the three bicycles chained to a tree; the pile of rotting pallets and the black plastic sacks spilling empty beer cans on to the pavement. They were there the last time he came, two weeks ago. He'd shoved a note through the door asking the old git to get them moved. Clearly, he hasn't.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The door opens. It's Tim Knight, his architect, a roll of plans in hand. He smiles broadly and waves his client in.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Mr Sexton - good to see you again. I think you're going to be pleased with the progress we've made.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I bloody well hope so,' says Sexton, with heavy irony. 'This morning can't get much worse.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Let's start at the top.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two men head up, their footsteps booming on the stripped wood. Upstairs, local radio is on full volume and there are builders in most of the rooms. Two plasterers on the top floor, a plumber in the en-suite bathroom and a specialist window restorer working on the sashes. One or two of the workmen glance over at Sexton but he doesn't make eye contact. He's got his tablet out and is annotating every job, and querying most of them.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They end up in the extension out at the back, where the old brick lean-to has been knocked down and a huge double-height glass and metal space is being built in its stead. Beyond the trees sloping down at the bottom of the garden they can just see the Georgian elegance of Crescent Square. Sexton wishes he could have afforded one of those, but hey, the market's gone up 5 per cent since he bought this place, so he's not complaining. He gets the architect to take him through the plans for the kitchen ('Jesus, you don't get much for sixty grand, do you? They don't even throw in a sodding dishwasher'), then he turns, looking for the door to the cellar stairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knight looks a little apprehensive.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Ah, I was coming to that. There's been a bit of a hitch on the cellar.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sexton's eyes narrow. 'What do you mean, hitch?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Trevor rang me yesterday. They've hit an issue with the party wall. We may need a proper legal agreement before we can fix it - whatever we do will affect next door.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sexton makes a face. 'Oh for fuck's sake, we can't afford to get the bloody lawyers involved. What sort of a sodding problem?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'They started taking off the plaster so they could chase in the new cabling but some of the brickwork was in a pretty bad way. God knows how long it's been since Mrs Pardew went down there.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Stupid old bat,' mutters Sexton, which Knight decides to ignore. This is a very lucrative job.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Anyway,' he says, 'I'm afraid one of the young lads didn't realize quick enough what he was dealing with. Don't worry, though, we're going to get the structural engineer in tomorrow -'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Sexton is already pushing past him. 'Let me see for my bloody self.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The light bulb on the cellar stairs flickers bleakly as the two of them make their way down. The whole place reeks of mildew.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Mind where you're treading,' says Knight, 'some of these steps aren't safe. You could break your neck down here in the dark.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Have you got a torch?' calls Sexton, a few yards ahead. 'I can't see a bloody thing.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knight passes one down and Sexton snaps it on. He can see the problem straight away. Paint is blistering from what's left of the old yellowing plaster and, underneath, most of the bricks are crumbling with dry grey mould. There's a crack as wide as his finger from floor to ceiling that wasn't there before.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Christ, are we going to have to underpin the whole bloody house? How come the surveyor missed this?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knight looks apologetic. 'Mrs Pardew had units all along that wall. He wouldn't have been able to get behind them.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'And more to the point, how come no one was monitoring that stupid little tosser who's taken lumps out of my fucking wall -'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He picks up one of the builder's tools from the floor and starts poking at the bricks. The architect steps forward. 'Seriously, I wouldn't do that -'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A brick falls away, then another, and then a chunk of masonry slips and crashes into dust at their feet. This time, Sexton's shoes don't escape the mess, but he doesn't notice. He's staring, mouth open, at the wall.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's a hole, perhaps two inches wide.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And in the gloom beyond, a face.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* * *<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the St Aldate's police station newly promoted Detective Sergeant Gareth Quinn is on his second coffee and his third round of toast, his expensive tie flipped over one shoulder to keep it out of the crumbs. The expensive tie that goes with the expensive suit and the general aura of being just a bit too smart to be an ordinary copper. And that's smart in both senses of the word, needless to say. The rest of the CID office is half empty; just Chris Gislingham and Verity Everett have arrived so far. The team don't have a big case right now and DI Fawley is out all day at a conference, so it's the rare indulgence of a late start followed by the always-enticing prospect of catching up with the paperwork.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's a moment, dust floating in the sun slanting through the blinds, the rustle of Quinn's newspaper, the smell of coffee. And then the phone rings. It's 9.17.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn reaches over and picks it up.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'CID.' Then, 'Shit. You sure?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gislingham and Everett look up. Gislingham, who's always described as 'sturdy' and 'solid', and not just because he's getting a bit chunky round the middle. Gislingham, who - unlike Quinn - hasn't made DS and, given his age, probably won't now. But don't judge him on that. Every CID team needs a Gislingham, and if you were drowning, he's the one you'd want on the other end of the rope. As for Everett, she's someone else you can't afford to judge on appearances: she may look like Miss Marple must have done at thirty-five, but she's every bit as relentless. Or as Gislingham always puts it, Ev was definitely a bloodhound in a previous life.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn's still talking into the phone. 'And there's definitely no answer next door? OK. No - we're on it. Tell uniform to meet us there, and make sure they bring at least one female officer.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gislingham's already reaching for his jacket. Quinn puts the phone down and takes a last bite of his toast as he gets to his feet. 'That was the switchboard. Someone called from Frampton Road - says there's a girl in the cellar next door.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'In the cellar?' says Everett, her eyes widening.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Someone knocked through the wall by mistake. There's an old bloke living in the house, apparently. But they can't raise him.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Oh fuck.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Yup. That's about the size of it.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When they pull up outside the house a crowd is already gathering. Some of them are clearly the builders from number 31, glad of any excuse to stop working that won't get them more shit from Sexton; others are probably neighbours, and there�s a scatter of revellers with flowers in their hats and cans of lager in hand who look decidedly the worse for wear. The slightly surreal atmosphere isn�t helped by the life-size plastic cow pulled up by the kerb, draped in a floral tablecloth with daffodils round its horns. A couple of Morris men have started an impromptu performance on the pavement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Blimey,' says Gislingham as Quinn switches off the engine. 'Do you think we can get them for parking that thing without a permit?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They get out and walk across the road, just as two patrol cars draw up on the other side. One of the women in the crowd wolf whistles at Quinn and falls about laughing when he turns to look at her. Three uniformed officers join them from the cars. One of them has a battering ram; the female officer is Erica Somer. Gislingham spots a glance between her and Quinn, and sees the smile in her eyes at his embarrassment. So that's how it is, he thinks. He'd suspected those two might have a thing going. Like he said to Janet the other night, he's caught the two of them at the coffee machine together far too many times to be just coincidence. Not that he can blame Quinn - she's a looker all right, even in uniform and sensible shoes. He just hopes she doesn't expect too much: if Quinn was a dog, no one would call him Fido.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Do we know the name of the old man who lives here?' asks Quinn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'A Mr William Harper, Sarge,' says Somer. 'We've called the paramedics, just in case there really is a girl there.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I know what I bloody well saw.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn turns. A man in the sort of suit Quinn would buy if he had the money. Slim cut, silk weave, and a claret satin lining that glares with a purple check shirt and a pink spotted tie. He has 'City' written all over him. As well as 'Very Pissed Off'.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Look,' the man says, 'how long is all this going to take? I have a meeting with my lawyer at three and if the traffic's as bad getting back -'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Sorry, sir, and you are?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Mark Sexton. Next door - I own it.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'So you were the one who called us?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Yeah, that was me. I was down in the cellar with my architect and part of the wall gave way. There's a girl in there. I know what I saw and, unlike this rabble, I'm not half-cut. Ask Knight - he saw it too.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Right,' says Quinn, gesturing the officer with the battering ram up to the door. 'Let's get on with it. And get that lot on the pavement under control too, will you? It's like something out of the fucking Wicker Man out here.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Quinn moves away Sexton calls him back. 'Hey - what about my bloody builders - when can they get back in?'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quinn ignores him, but as Gislingham passes he taps him on the shoulder. 'Sorry, mate,' Gislingham says cheerily, 'that posh refurb is just going to have to wait.'<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the front step, Quinn pounds on the door. 'Mr Harper! Thames Valley Police. If you're in there, please open the door or we will be forced to break it down.'</p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Ireland: 2019</h2><p><p><i>DK Eyewitness travel guides: award-winning guidebooks</i><br><br>Discover Ireland with this essential travel guide to this great island, designed to help you create your own unique trip and to transport you there before you&#x2019;ve even packed your case &#x2013; step back in time at Newgrange and other ancient sites across the country, explore the legendary Giant&#x2019;s Causeway, or sample Dublin&#x2019;s best pubs and restaurants. &nbsp;The DK Eyewitness Guide to Ireland covers the must-see sights and the hidden corners, so you won&#x2019;t miss a thing.<br><br>� <b>Gorgeous, all-new color photography</b> so you can imagine yourself there<br>� <b>Reasons to love Ireland</b>: world-class museums, breathtaking scenery, ancient castles, and the indefinable craic &#x2013; what will yours be?<br>� <b>See Ireland from a different angle</b> - 38 pages of fresh ideas for exploring the island<br>� A year-long calendar of events in Ireland gives a selection of local events and festivals for all seasons<br>�&nbsp;<b>Expert advice</b> covers the practical stuff: get ready, get around and stay safe<br>�<b> Detailed, color maps</b> help you navigate the country with ease<br>�&nbsp;<b>Expert tips</b> to make memories that last &#x2013;&nbsp;where to snap and share the perfect photo, take in stunning views and escape the crowds<br>�&nbsp;<b>The most authentic places to stay, eat, drink and shop</b><br>�&nbsp;<b>Easy-to-follow walks and itineraries</b> take you on a tour of each area, with plenty of eat and drink stops en route.<br>� <b>Hand-drawn illustrations</b> show the inside of the must-see attractions, including Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Christ Church Cathedral, Powerscourt Estate and Bantry House<br>�&nbsp;<b>Covers</b> Southeast Dublin; Southwest Dublin; North of the Liffey; Beyond Dublin&#x2019;s City Centre; Southeast Ireland; Cork and Kerry; the Lower Shannon; the West of Ireland; Northwest Ireland; the Midlands and Northern Ireland.<br><br><b>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Ireland</b> is a detailed, easy-to-use guide designed to help you create your own unique trip.<br><br><i>DK Eyewitness: winner of the Top Guidebook Series in the Wanderlust Reader Travel Awards 2017.</i> <br><br>On a city break?

It intersects with Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution, and collides with the horrors of Nazi eugenics in the 1940s. The gene transforms post-war biology. It reorganizes our understanding of sexuality, temperament, choice and free will. Above all, this is a story driven by human ingenuity and obsessive minds&#x2013;from Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel to Francis Crick, James Watson and Rosalind Franklin, and the thousands of scientists still working to understand the code of codes. This is an epic, moving history of a scientific idea being brought to life, by the author of The Emperor of All Maladies. But woven through The Gene, like a red line, is also an intimate history&#x2013;the story of Mukherjee&#x2019;s own family and its recurring pattern of mental illness, reminding us that genetics is vitally relevant to everyday lives. These concerns reverberate even</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2016:</strong> In 2010, Siddhartha Mukherjee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his book <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em>, a &#x201c;biography&#x201d; of cancer. Here, he follows up with a biography of the gene&#x2014;and <em>The Gene</em> is just as informative, wise, and well-written as that first book. Mukherjee opens with a survey of how the gene first came to be conceptualized and understood, taking us through the thoughts of Aristotle, Darwin, Mendel, Thomas Morgan, and others; he finishes the section with a look at the case of Carrie Buck (to whom the book is dedicated), who eventually was sterilized in 1927 in a famous American eugenics case. Carrie Buck&#x2019;s sterilization comes as a warning that informs the rest of the book. This is what can happen when we start tinkering with this most personal science and misunderstand the ethical implications of those tinkerings. Through the rest of <em>The Gene</em>, Mukherjee clearly and skillfully illustrates how the science has grown so much more advanced and complicated since the 1920s&#x2014;we are developing the capacity to directly manipulate the human genome&#x2014;and how the ethical questions have also grown much more complicated. We could ask for no wiser, more fascinating and talented writer to guide us into the future of our human heredity than Siddhartha Mukherjee. <em>--Chris Schluep</em>Siddhartha Mukherjee is a cancer physician and researcher.

Beef production in the United States had gone from small-scale, localized operations to a highly centralized industry spanning the country, with cattle bred on ranches in the rural West, slaughtered in Chicago, and consumed in the nation's rapidly growing cities. <i>Red Meat Republic</i> tells the remarkable story of the violent conflict over who would reap the benefits of this new industry and who would bear its heavy costs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Joshua Specht puts people at the heart of his story--the big cattle ranchers who helped to drive the nation's westward expansion, the meatpackers who created a radically new kind of industrialized slaughterhouse, and the stockyard workers who were subjected to the shocking and unsanitary conditions described by Upton Sinclair in his novel <i>The Jungle</i>. Specht brings to life a turbulent era marked by Indian wars, Chicago labor unrest, and food riots in the streets of New York. He shows how the enduring success of the cattle-beef complex--centralized, low cost, and meatpacker dominated--was a consequence of the meatpackers' ability to make their interests overlap with those of a hungry public, while the interests of struggling ranchers, desperate workers, and bankrupt butchers took a backseat. America--and the American table--would never be the same again.<br>&nbsp;<br>A compelling and unfailingly enjoyable read, <i>Red Meat Republic</i> reveals the complex history of exploitation and innovation behind the food we consume today.</p><p>A history of the beef industry in nineteenth-century America, looking at how changes in cattle farming, transport, and slaughter ultimately transformed American business, policy, and consumer culture and led to modern agribusiness.<b>Joshua Specht </b>teaches American history at Monash University in Australia.

But it took centuries of scientific effort&#x2015;and a lot of luck&#x2015;to discover and establish the diversity of dinosaur species we now know. How did we learn that <i>Triceratops</i> had three horns? Why don&#x2019;t many paleontologists consider <i>Brontosaurus</i> a valid species? What convinced scientists that modern birds are relatives of ancient <i>Velociraptor</i>?<br><br>In <i>The Story of the Dinosaurs in 25 Discoveries</i>, Donald R. Prothero tells the fascinating stories behind the most important fossil finds and the intrepid researchers who unearthed them. In twenty-five vivid vignettes, he weaves together dramatic tales of dinosaur discoveries with what modern science now knows about the species to which they belong. Prothero takes us from eighteenth-century sightings of colossal bones taken for biblical giants through recent discoveries of enormous predators even larger than <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. He recounts the escapades of the larger-than-life personalities who made modern paleontology, including scientific rivalries like the nineteenth-century &#x201c;Bone Wars.&#x201d; Prothero also details how to draw the boundaries between species and explores debates such as whether dinosaurs had feathers, explaining the findings that settled them or keep them going. Throughout, he offers a clear and rigorous look at what paleontologists consider sound interpretation of evidence. An essential read for any dinosaur lover, this book teaches us to see an ancient world ruled by giant majestic creatures anew.</p><p>Donald R.

It provides equal balance on both human history and the lives and adventures of the people behind the relevant dinosaurs, and scientific thinking on the dinosaurs themselves and adjacent areas of controversy. (Darren Naish, author of <i>Dinosaurs: How They Lived and Evolved</i>)<br><br>This book is excellent. Rather than simply a profile of twenty-five dinosaurs, it puts each of these in context of its discovery and significance in terms of the science of paleontology, as well as comparisons with close relations. Thus, it covers hundreds of dinosaurs, not just twenty-five. (Thomas R.

While vampires, werewolves and even serial killers command respect, the zombie is never treated as anything other than a buffoon who stumbles around in the cultural hinterlands messily decaying. There are no aristocrats, blue bloods or celebrities among zombies, no big name stars or instantly recognizable faces, just low-rent, anonymous monsters who usually can&#x2019;t talk, can barely walk and spend most of their energy trying to hold their decomposing bodies together. Zombies are the great unwashed of horror cinema, soulless creatures that wander around without personality or purpose - a grotesque parody of the end that awaits us all. For all their lack of finesse or style, though, the living dead have been a constant presence in horror films since the 1930s. In the many ways it has been deployed in western popular culture, the zombie has slowly been transformed, signifying something much more complex that just the fear of death. Bound up with a wide range of cultural anxieties - from American imperialism to domestic racial tensions, Depression era fears about unemployment, Cold War paranoia about brainwashing, post-1960s political disenfranchisement and AIDS era body horror - the zombie has become, as we will see, a potent symbol of the apocalypse. It&#x2019;s a monster whose appearance always threatens to challenge mankind&#x2019;s faith in the order of the universe. Forever poised in the space between the traditional Western understandings of white/black, civilized/savage, life/death, the zombie is a harbinger of doom. Its very existence hints at the possibility of a world that cannot be contained within the limits of human understanding, a world in which these binary oppositions no longer stand fixed. Trampling over our cherished certain certainties, the zombie is, above all else, a symbol of our ordered universe turned upside down as death becomes life and life becomes death. In the chapters that follow, this book hopes to explain the allure of such a catastrophic occurrence, placing the development of the zombie in its socio-historical context in an attempt to understand why it is that, after all these years, we are still so fascinated with the dead that walk.</p><h2>A Thousand Sons (12) (The Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Book twelve in the New York Times bestselling series<br><br>The Great Crusade is at its height, and the Thousand Sons are its most dedicated warriors.

He's the manic-depressive business partner invented by value investor Benjamin Graham....Grant's omnibus offers a blow-by-blow account of one man's battle with this crank, from dot-com binge to mortgage meltdown.</p><p> </p><p>Grant's reputation precedes him. His newsletter has enriched, amused and irritated subscribers for 25 years. As founder, editor and rewrite man (as he puts it), Grant calls himself "a Grover Cleveland Democrat who favors free markets and traditional business attire."</p><p> </p><p>The chapters are arranged thematically, allowing you to jump around. My favorites are in the bits where Mr. Market buys a house and Grant dissects "mortgage science projects," including some particularly toxic collateralized debt obligations.</p><p> </p><p>There's something of the thriller buried in here, as our detective follows the trail leading from Greenspan's low Federal Funds rates (1 percent for almost a year) to the proliferation of interest-only mortgages and the subprime debacle.</p><p> </p><p>Throughout, the reporting is detailed and precise. The tone is wise yet unpretentious, and Grant knows how to cut through financial fog and conjure up images straight out of a Dr. Seuss. - Bloomberg News</p><p></p>"Mr. Market Miscalculates: The Bubble Years and Beyond"...

That anything less than sexual multiplicity . . . is naive? That our sexual selves are merely idylers in a vast wood?" Thus the central theme of John Hawkes's widely acclaimed novel <em>The Blood Oranges</em> is boldly asserted by its narrator, Cyril, the archetypal multisexualist. Likening himself to a white bull on Love's tapestry, he pursues his romantic vision in a primitive Mediterranean landscape. There two couples&#x2015;Cyril and Fiona, Hugh and Catherine&#x2015;mingle their loves in an "lllyria" that brings to mind the equally timeless countryside of Shakespeare's <em>Twelfth Night</em>.</p><p>John Hawkes&nbsp;(1925&#x2013;1998) was a postmodern novelist born in Stamford, Connecticut, and educated at Harvard University. He was noted for his unconventional style and views on the creation of literature and was admired by Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Robert Penn Warren, Saul Bellow, Anthony Burgess, Jeffrey Eugenides, and Donald Barthelme.&#x201c;The sixth and most accessible novel by, feasibly, our best writer. . .

Sensitively translated into English for the first time by Damion Searls, 28 Paradises captures the exquisite sadness of waking from a beautiful dream. There are twenty-eight dreams in this book, or perhaps one dream in twenty-eight parts&#x2014;visions of paradise imagined by Zehrfuss during a time of deep sadness. Captured first in Zehrfuss&#x2019;s brightly colored gouaches, each paradise was then refashioned as a poem by Modiano. Zehrfuss&#x2019;s paintings are Edens in miniature, and rather than describe them outright, Modiano dreams himself into these reveries in quiet, understated verse. The reader enters this shared realm in an experience less like paging through a book and more like slipping into a shared world. These paradises are wishes for moments when a painting, or a poem, or a lover&#x2014;perhaps they are not so different&#x2014;relieves the loneliness of being human. As Modiano writes with a touch of wistfulness, &#x201c;The Lilliputian painted her paradises / And I / Next to her / Wrote a poem.&#x201d; A pure example of ekphrastic writing&#x2014;poetry inspired by paintings&#x2014;this book shows how writing and visual art can together create a unique emotional experience.</p><p>Patrick Modiano spent his childhood between Paris, Haute-Savoie, and Jouy-en-Josas. Having been awarded his baccalaureate, he dedicated himself to literature at the age of eighteen. It was Raymond Queneau who introduced to him the literary circles of Paris in the 1960s. He won the Grand Prix du roman de l&#x2019;Acad�mie fran�aise in 1972 and the Prix Goncourt in 1978. In 2014, his &#x153;uvre was crowned with the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p><h2>The Undressing: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>Celebrated poet Li-Young Lee returns with a breathtaking new volume about the violence of desire and the peace of love.</strong></p><p><em>The Undressing</em> is a tonic for spiritual anemia; it attempts to uncover things hidden since the dawn of the world. Short of achieving that end, these mysterious, unassuming poems investigate the human violence and dispossession increasingly prevalent around the world, as well as the horrors the poet grew up with as a child of refugees. Lee draws from disparate sources, including the Old Testament, the Dao De Jing, and the music of the Wu Tang Clan.

The lens he invented was a brilliant feat of engineering that made lighthouses blaze many times brighter, farther, and more efficiently. Battling the establishment, his own poor health, and the limited technology of the time, Fresnel was able to achieve his goal of illuminating the entire French coast. At first, the British sought to outdo the new Fresnel-equipped lighthouses as a matter of national pride. Americans, too, resisted abandoning their primitive lamps, but the superiority of the Fresnel lens could not be&nbsp;denied for long. Soon, from&nbsp;Dunkirk to Saigon, shores were brightened with it.&nbsp; The Fresnel legacy played an important role in geopolitical events, including the American Civil War. No sooner were Fresnel lenses finally installed along U.S. shores than they were drafted: the Union blockaded the Confederate coast; the Confederacy set about thwarting it by dismantling and hiding or destroying the powerful new lights. <p>Levitt&#x2019;s scientific and historical account, rich in anecdote and personality, brings to life the fascinating untold story of Augustin Fresnel and his powerful invention.</p> 60 illustrations, 6 maps</p><p>Theresa Levitt held the McDonnell-Barksdale Chair of History of Science at the University of Mississippi and is associate professor of history there.

According to conventional wisdom, gay liberation started with the Stonewall Riots in Greenwich Village in 1969. The 1970s represented a moment of triumph--both political and sexual--before the AIDS crisis in the subsequent decade, which, in the view of many, exposed the problems inherent in the so-called "gay lifestyle".<br><br>In <i>Stand by Me</i>, the acclaimed historian Jim Downs rewrites the history of gay life in the 1970s, arguing that the decade was about much more than sex and marching in the streets. Drawing on a vast trove of untapped records at LGBT community centers in Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia, Downs tells moving, revelatory stories of gay people who stood together--as friends, fellow believers, and colleagues--to create a sense of community among people who felt alienated from mainstream American life.<br><br>As Downs shows, gay people found one another in the Metropolitan Community Church, a nationwide gay religious group; in the pages of the <i>Body Politic</i>, a newspaper that encouraged its readers to think of their sexuality as a political identity; at the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, the hub of gay literary life in New York City; and at theaters putting on "Gay American History," a play that brought to the surface the enduring problem of gay oppression.<br><br>These and many other achievements would be largely forgotten after the arrival in the early 1980s of HIV/AIDS, which allowed critics to claim that sex was the defining feature of gay liberation. This reductive narrative set back the cause of gay rights and has shaped the identities of gay people for decades.<br><br>An essential act of historical recovery, <i>Stand by Me</i> shines a bright light on a triumphant moment, and will transform how we think about gay life in America from the 1970s into the present day.</p><p><b>Jim Downs</b>, is a Mellon New Directions Fellow at Harvard University and an associate professor of history at Connecticut College. The author of the critically acclaimed <i>Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction</i>, he has also written for <i>Time</i>, the <i>Huffington Post</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i>, among other publications. Downs lives in Cambridge, MA."Downs has an instinct for historically relevant stories and he tells them well.... In the chapter 'Prison Sounds,' Downs offers similarly invigorating detective work, digging up aspects of LGBT activism that have eluded most historians."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Boston Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Downs capably blends authority and warmth in this thoughtful reexamination of an era."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Intelligent and thought-provoking."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b><br><br>"The sheer act of Downs' acknowledging that not all gay men subscribed to the popular 'three Big Bs' of the time--'the Bars, Beaches, and Baths'--and found their identity validated and articulated through the communal practices of Christian worship and cultural hubs (like the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop) is a refreshing and invigorating experience. <i>Stand By Me</i> proves a deeply moving read, one that passionately and urgently argues for us to acknowledge some of the forgotten history of gay liberation."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Downs infuses great passion and intent in every paragraph, striving to the raise the level of discourse even as he's tossing outmoded ideas aside left and right. This is history as it should be told, as complex and as personal as possible."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Manhattan Book Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Stand by Me</i> includes massacre and tragedy; its opening chapter is an emotional rehashing of the 1973 arson attack--the most lethal targeting of gay people in American history until the June 12 massacre at Orlando's Pulse club--took the lives of 32 men during a religious service.... The passages that grab you most...address the 'usable past,' which Downs defines as the facets of history that provide gay people with 'legitimacy, meaning, and, most of all, a genealogy to their plight.' And his passion is infectious."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Public Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Stand By Me</i> is not duplicative of other accounts. It is to our movement an equivalent to Howard Zinn's <i>A People's History of the United States</i>."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Lambda Literary</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Stand By Me</i> is a laudable, thoroughly researched corrective to the prevalent idea of gay people in the 1970s as uninvolved, unengaged sex-crazed hedonists."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>A &amp; U Magazine</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Downs makes a good case for us to remember that the zeal for liberation in the '70s was deeply and directly informed by feminist politics, and thus was only ever in part, primarily or even strongly, about sexual liberation.... [A] diverting book with considerable virtues."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Gay &amp; Lesbian Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This book is informative, sometimes horrifying, interesting and, unlike your old high school history books, it's never dry."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Washington Blade</i></b></i></b></p><h2>The Dark Lord&#39;s Demise (The Archives of Anthropos, Book 6)</h2><p>The king of Anthropos has a baffling illness and is threatened by the Dark Lord who has troubled that mysterious land so many times before.

Now, at a moment when technology has inflamed tribal hatreds and the planet is beset by unnatural calamities, he is back with a new collection of essays that recall us to more humane ways of being in the world. </p><p>Franzen&#x2019;s great loves are literature and birds, and <i>The End of the End of the Earth</i> is a passionate argument for both. Where the new media tend to confirm one&#x2019;s prejudices, he writes, literature &#x201c;invites you to ask whether you might be somewhat wrong, maybe even entirely wrong, and to imagine why someone else might hate you.&#x201d; Whatever his subject, Franzen&#x2019;s essays are always skeptical of received opinion, steeped in irony, and frank about his own failings. He&#x2019;s frank about birds, too (they kill &#x201c;everything imaginable&#x201d;), but his reporting and reflections on them&#x2015;on seabirds in New Zealand, warblers in East Africa, penguins in Antarctica&#x2015;are both a moving celebration of their beauty and resilience and a call to action to save what we love.</p><p>Calm, poignant, carefully argued, full of wit, <i>The End of the End of the Earth</i> provides a welcome breath of hope and reason.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan Franzen</b> is the author of <i>Purity</i> and other novels, most recently <i>The Corrections</i> and <i>Freedom.</i> His works of nonfiction and translation include <i>Farther Away</i> and <i>The Kraus Project</i>, all published by FSG.

The colours in Hashim&#39;s work really &#34;sing&#34;. I have attended two of his workshops and this book takes me further with his technique. If you want to produce paintings that are really sensational then buy this book.-&#34;Diane Rensch&#34;, Amazon * Customer * May 12 Acrylics are often described as the most versatile painting medium. The range of effects and colours is huge. So how can artists make best use of them? Often the sheer vibrancy of the colours can be off putting for artists more accustomed to the gentler palettes of watercolour and oils. Akib has created a book which helps artists use acrylics to their best advantage. A skilled artist and illustrator, he provides several step by step projects to demonstrate techniques such as creating woodland light, drawing animals and still life projects. Advice too is given on good drawing techniques, creating a composition and developing tone and colour. Hints are given on using acrylics in abstract paintings to make light tracks, as well as an unusual project showing how to paint crowds of people. This is not a subject that is often covered but in the modern day world, the rush hour and crowds of people offer lots of potential for townscapes. An interesting book, offering some new ideas on how to use this paint medium. This is a book that will be useful to both beginners and advanced artists. * Monstersandcritics.com * May 12 Fantastic book covering painting in acrylics for total beginners but with so much information it will appeal to established users also. Hashim advocates using big brushes with large quantities of undiluted pure paint to quickly create and build up layers and depth to produce fresh rich paintings. Hashim shows in this book how to utilise what I call &#34;mark making&#34; - there&#39;s bound to be a correct term but I don&#39;t know it - to create what close up look like dashes of pure paint dotted onto the painting but seen from further back merge to create bright but realistic scenes. Its something I love but struggle with - I&#39;m always tempted to refine too much and lose that lovely freshness this type of style creates - armed with this book I intend to try further. There&#39;s the usual advice found in these books on materials and techniques but some valuable but lesser heard tips such as timing oneself and stepping back form the painting every fifteen minutes. This allows us to look at what we&#39;ve done and what needs to be done instead of - my biggest fault - becoming so immersed in the work that it becomes overdone and loses that fresh bright appeal. Hashim says each brush-stroke should count and when one is taking frequent breaks to look at what&#39;s been done and what needs to be done its easier to make it so - instead of the slap on more paint and hope approach I often use...... there are numerous illustrations throughout the book showing exactly what Hashim means when he is explaining how to lay colour or use the brush in a certain way which is really helpful. There are also many useful exercises to practise that you&#39;ve understood what he&#39;s saying. The subject themselves range from animals and portraits to still life and landscapes - really does contain a bit of everything and it makes it easy to see how the technique of big brush considered paint strokes can be used in so many different subjects. An inspiring book useful and appealing to any artist, whether new to acrylics or an established user, who wishes to retain freshness and vitality in their paintings. I know I will find it very valuable. * JeannieZelos.com *</p><h2>Nature and Madness</h2><p>Through much of history our relationship with the earth has been plagued by ambivalence&#x2015;we not only enjoy and appreciate the forces and manifestations of nature, we seek to plunder, alter, and control them. Here Paul Shepard uncovers the cultural roots of our ecological crisis and proposes ways to repair broken bonds with the earth, our past, and nature. Ultimately encouraging, he notes, "There is a secret person undamaged in every individual. We have not lost, and cannot lose, the genuine impulse."</p><p>Does any species other than the human befoul its nest, destroy the habitat on which it depends? Strangely, yes; such shortsightedness happens in the natural world all the time. But no species does so with as much conscious awareness, a matter that fascinated the philosopher Paul Shepard. In <i>Nature and Madness</i> he examines the human animal in relation to the natural environment, showing the kinds of psychic disjunctions and troubles that have developed over the generations that humans have been seeking to distance themselves from the world. Shepard locates the source of much of those troubles in the invention of agriculture, an act that gave humans the false idea that nature can be controlled and micromanaged in every detail--an idea that has found modern fruit in such things as dam-building and genetic engineering. Environmental destruction, writes Shepard, is a "mutilation of personal maturity," a failure of emotional development; continuing the metaphor, he adds that "the only society more frightful than one run by children ... might be one run by childish adults." Shepard calls on his readers to establish a meaningful, mature connection with the earth, to cultivate a sense of stewardship and responsibility. It is a welcome call. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>PAUL SHEPARD (1925-1996) was Avery Professor of Natural Philosophy and Human Ecology at Pitzer College in Claremont, California. He is the author of twelve books, a number of which are available from the University of Georgia Press.</p><h2>Chastise: The Dambusters Story 1943</h2><p><p><b><strong>A brand new history of the Dambusters raid from best-selling and critically acclaimed military historian, Max Hastings.</strong></b></p><p>Operation Chastise, the destruction of the Mohne and Eder dams in north-west Germany by the RAF&#x2019;s 617 Squadron on the night of 16/17 May 1943, was an epic that has passed into Britain&#x2019;s national legend.</p><p>Max Hastings grew up embracing the story, the classic 1955 movie and the memory of Guy Gibson, the 24-year-old wing-commander who led the raid. In the 21st Century, however, he urges that we should see the dambusters in much more complex shades. The aircrew&#x2019;s heroism was entirely real, as was the brilliance of Barnes Wallis, inventor of the &#x2018;bouncing bombs&#x2019;. But commanders who promised their young fliers that success could shorten the war fantasised as ruthlessly as they did about the entire bomber offensive. Some 1,400 civilians perished in the biblical floods that swept through the Mohne valley, more than half of them Russian and Polish women, slave labourers.</p><p>Hastings vividly describes the evolution of Wallis&#x2019; bomb, and of the squadron which broke the dams. But he also portrays in harrowing detail those swept away by the torrents. He argues that what modern Germans call the Mohnekatastrophe imposed on the Nazi war machine temporary disruption, rather than a crippling blow. Ironically, Air Marshal Sir Arthur &#x2018;Bomber&#x2019; Harris gained much of the public credit, though he bitterly opposed Chastise as a distraction from his city-burning blitz. Harris also made perhaps the operation&#x2019;s biggest mistake &#x2013; failure to launch a conventional attack on the huge post-raid repair operation which could have transformed the impact of the dam breaches on Ruhr industry.</p><p>Here once again is a dramatic retake on familiar history by a master of the art. Hastings sets the Dams Raid in the big picture of the bomber offensive and of the Second World War, with moving portraits of the young airmen, so many of whom died; of Barnes Wallis; the monstrous Harris; the tragic Guy Gibson, together with superb narrative of the action of one of the most extraordinary episodes in British history.</p></p><p></p><h2>Letterman: The Last Giant of Late Night</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>New York Times Notable Book of 2017</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong> </p><p><em>New York Times</em> comedy critic Jason Zinoman delivers the definitive story of the life and artistic legacy of David Letterman, the greatest television talk show host of all time and the signature comedic voice of a generation.</p><p>In a career spanning more than thirty years, David Letterman redefined the modern talk show with an ironic comic style that transcended traditional television.

Boudnik and Hrabal had a close and often contentious friendship. For a brief period, in the early 1950s, they both worked in the steel works in Kladno and lived in the same building in Prague.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Written in the early seventies, Hrabal&#x2019;s anecdotal portrait of Boudnik includes another controversial member of that early group of the Czech avant-garde: the poet Egon Bondy. While Hrabal and Bondy were evolving their aesthetic of &#x201c;total realism,&#x201d; Boudnik developed his own artistic approach that he called &#x201c;Explosionalism,&#x201d; in which the boundaries between life and art become blurred, and everyday events take on the appearance and the substance of art.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hrabal&#x2019;s portrait of Boudnik captures the strange atmosphere of a time in which the traditional values and structures of everyday life in Czechoslovakia were being radically dismantled by the Communists. But as <em>The Gentle Barbarian</em> demonstrates, creative spirits are able to reject, ignore, or burrow beneath the superficial &#x201c;revolutionary&#x201d; atmosphere of the time, and find humor, inspiration, and a kind of salvation amidst its general intellectual and creative poverty.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Bohumil Hrabal</strong> (1914-1997) was born in Moravia. He is the author of such classics as <em>Closely Watched Trains</em> (made into an Academy-Award winning film by Jiri Menzel), <em>The Death of Mr. Baltisberger</em>, <em>I Served the King of England</em>, and <em>Too Loud a Solitude</em>.

In this hilarious and captivating book, CBC personality Grant Lawrence adds a whole new chapter to the saga of this storied piece of BC coastline.<br><br>Young Grant's father bought a piece of land next to the park in the 1970s, just in time to encounter the gun-toting cougar lady, left-over hippies, outlaw bikers and an assortment of other characters. In those years Desolation Sound was a place where going to the neighbours' potluck meant being met with hugs from portly naked hippies and where Russell the Hermit's school of life (boating, fishing, and rock 'n' roll) was Grant's personal Enlightenment--an influence that would take him away from the coast to a life of music and journalism and eventually back again.<br><br>With rock band buddies and a few cases of beer in tow, an older, cooler Grant returns to regale us with tales of "going bush," the tempting dilemma of finding an unguarded grow-op, and his awkward struggle to convince a couple of visiting kayakers that he's a legit CBC radio host while sporting a wild beard and body wounds and gesticulating with a machete.

Perkins's humorous and poignant observations about Debbie, who wants something to happen, and Hector, who learns to play guitar, are compelling. Danielle Ferland remembers her own youth well or has hung out with teenagers recently. Her portrayal of their budding self-awareness bordering on self-consciousness is especially sharp, and she perfectly mimics the questions? teens ask when talking? in addition to their sarcastic downturns and flat tones. Ferland also easily navigates the potentially treacherous waters of Perkins's sometimes- experimental prose, which includes haiku, poetry, and Q &amp; A formats.

Her father&#x2019;s too-tender care of her has made her stepmother wildly jealous, and so Hester sets off, knowing only that she can&#x2019;t stay. Hester&#x2019;s natural instincts for navigating the forests in colonial Pennsylvania along with the book of medicines and remedies given to her by an aged Native American woman allow her to survive until she gets sick from drinking river water.<br><br>Twice rescued first by matronly Indian women who find her unconscious in the woods, and then by a boy in downtown Lancaster, where she&#x2019;d been left for dead by the dreaded Paxton boys Hester finds herself in the kind, if rough, hands of Emma Ferree. Because of her wide heart, Ferree, a widow, offers her home to fugitives.<br><br>The dazzlingly beautiful Hester eventually marries an Amish man, who is more in love with the way she looks than with her heart and mind. And when that childless marriage falters, she is met one day in the fields by Running Bear, a Native American brave who has watched her for years. He asks her to marry him, giving her until wintertime to decide.<br><br>Belonging in part to two worlds, but experiencing a subtle yet clear rejection from both, Hester comes to wish that her Amish mother, Kate, had never rescued her.<br><br>Author Linda Byler shows the lovely and enduring Hester caring for others as the Amish do, with the use of Native American remedies and tinctures from the old woman&#x2019;s book. Her practices raise accusations of witchcraft from the very people she sets out to help. Byler, an active member of the Amish, centers this second book in the Hester's Hunt for Home series on two anguishing questions: Where is Hester&#x2019;s heart most at home?

It begins with the Harlem Renaissance, continues through civil rights, the Black Arts Movement, and on into contemporary debates of poststructuralist and black feminist theory. Drawing on a quote from Frederick Douglass for the title of this book, Angelyn Mitchell explains in her introduction the importance for those "within the circle" of African American literature to examine their own works and to engage this critical canon. <br>The essays in this collection&#x2014;many of which are not widely available today&#x2014;either initiated or gave critical definition to specific periods or movements of African American literature. They address issues such as integration, separatism, political action, black nationalism, Afrocentricity, black feminism, as well as the role of art, the artist, the critic, and the audience. With selections from Langston Hughes, Sterling Brown, W. E. B. DuBois, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Barbara Smith, Alice Walker, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and many others, this definitive collection provides a dynamic model of the cultural, ideological, historical, and aesthetic considerations in African American literature and literary criticism. <br>A major contribution to the study of African American literature, this volume will serve as a foundation for future work by students and scholars. Its importance will be recognized by all those interested in modern literary theory as well as general readers concerned with the African American experience.<p></p><p><i>Selections by (partial list):</i> Houston A.

He met Rene Goscinny in 1951 and on 29 October 1959 their most famous creation, Asterix, made his first appearance on page 20 of Pilote.

Liu Bang, the founder of a Chinese dynasty, begins his life as a peasant. Sun Tzu, a fearless war strategist, writes one of the most popular books of all time. These are just a few of the captivating figures you'll meet in <em>The Ancient Chinese World</em>. <br><br>Terry Kleeman and Tracy Barrett use a rich variety of intriguing primary sources-turtle shells, clay pots, an ancient wall, folk songs, poetry, and more-to construct a lively history of the politicians, farmers, warriors, and philosophers who created and shaped the ancient Chinese world. They also show us the fascinating process of constructing the historical jigsaw puzzle. Archaeologists discover a 400,000-year-old skull near modern-day Beijing and determine that it is one of our earliest human ancestors. A scholar who is prescribed "dragon bones" to cure an illness realizes that the bones-which are actually turtle shells-contain ancient Chinese writing used to send messages to the gods. The fantastic discovery of Lady Hao's tomb reveals that in ancient China a powerful woman led soldiers into battle. The letters exchanged by two military leaders show not only how the Chinese invented the sword, but also how they used the kite as a military weapon. Using these ancient artifacts and writings, Kleeman and Barrett weave the dramatic story of rulers, writers, soldiers, and citizens who made up the fascinating and unique world of ancient China.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terry Kleeman</strong> is associate professor of Chinese and religious studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Its 23 chapters progress chronologically, but each has a focus (e.g., the Shang, warfare, Buddhism, crafts, the role of women), and several of them engagingly retell the story of a memorable person, like Shensheng, Lady Hao, Laozi, and Wang Mang. A pronunciation chart is provided, along with phonetic versions of each name in a short "Cast of Characters." Primary-source material used throughout is identified in situ. Fascinating sidebars, superb maps, and color photos and reproductions with informative captions add utility and appeal. Women are as much a part of the story as possible (considering their generally low status). A time line covering 700,000 B.C.E. to 589 C.E. helps to sort out reigns, but some dates differ from those on a dynastic sidebar. Further-reading suggestions are organized under subject heads and include 17 annotated Web sites. Unfortunately, there are some glitches in the index. Nonetheless, this book contains a wealth of information, even if it isn't entirely accessible.<i>&#x2013;Patricia D.

But the closer John gets to the truth, the more dangerous his investigation becomes, until a shattering faceoff in an East Village tenement changes his life forever.<br><br> <i>Little Girl Lost</i> is a stunning debut novel from a celebrated writer whose short stories have been selected for <i>Best Mystery Stories of the Year</i> and <i>The Year&#x2019;s Best Horror Stories</i> as well as short-listed for the Shamus Award by the Private Eye Writers of America.</p><p><b>Richard Aleas</b> is the pseudonym of an Edgar and Shamus Award-winning mystery writer and editor whose work has appeared in dozens of publications including <i>Ellery Queen&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine</i> and <i>Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine </i>as well as anthologies such as <i>Best Mystery Stories of the Year</i> and <i>The Year&#x2019;s Best Horror Stories.</i>Aleas's debut barrels forth at the speed of one of the Manhattan taxis its protagonist frequently catches and contains some whiplash-inducing plot twists. John Blake, an NYU dropout turned PI, is stunned to learn that his high school girlfriend, Miranda, who he thought went to medical school and then on to lead a tame life in the Midwest, actually became a stripper. Even more shocking&#x2014;she's been murdered. Angry and confused, Blake looks into Miranda's past, beginning at a 10th-rate strip joint owned by some unsavory characters. A dancer there helps him at her peril, and he endures some beatings himself as he nears the surprise conclusion. Still, despite the seedy settings, Aleas's writing is more tinged with insight than blood; Blake reflects that "there is such a thing as... a sense of duty to the things of your past, even if they're not quite as beautiful as you remember." Gritty New York streets and scummy apartments flash by briskly, but Aleas has a detective's eye for detail, which allows him to create some atmospheric scenes (when Blake walks through a busy section of Queens, he notes everything from the kosher certification sign in a bakery's window to a drugstore's "out-of-season Coppertone displays"). Tightly written from start to finish, this crime novel is as satisfyingly edgy as the pulp classics that inspired it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Determined from an early age to create a Jewish state, he thereupon took control of the Zionist movement, declared Israel&#x2019;s independence, and navigated his country through wars, controversies and remarkable achievements. And yet Ben-Gurion remains an enigma&#x2015;he could be driven and imperious, or quizzical and confounding. </p><p>In this definitive biography, Israel&#x2019;s leading journalist-historian Tom Segev uses large amounts of previously unreleased archival material to give an original, nuanced account, transcending the myths and legends that have accreted around the man. Segev&#x2019;s probing biography ranges from the villages of Poland to Manhattan libraries, London hotels, and the hills of Palestine, and shows us Ben-Gurion&#x2019;s relentless activity across six decades. Along the way, Segev reveals for the first time Ben-Gurion&#x2019;s secret negotiations with the British on the eve of Israel&#x2019;s independence, his willingness to countenance the forced transfer of Arab neighbors, his relative indifference to Jerusalem, and his occasional &#x201c;nutty moments&#x201d;&#x2015;from UFO sightings to plans for Israel to acquire territory in South America. Segev also reveals that Ben-Gurion first heard about the Holocaust from a Palestinian Arab acquaintance, and explores his tempestuous private life, including the testimony of four former lovers.</p><p>The result is a full and startling portrait of a man who sought a state &#x201c;at any cost&#x201d;&#x2015;at times through risk-taking, violence, and unpredictability, and at other times through compromise, moderation, and reason. Segev&#x2019;s Ben-Gurion is neither a saint nor a villain but rather a historical actor who belongs in the company of Lenin or Churchill&#x2015;a twentieth-century leader whose iron will and complex temperament left a complex and contentious legacy that we still reckon with today.</p></p><p><p><b>Tom Segev</b> is among Israel&#x2019;s leading journalists and historians. His works include <i>The Seventh Million</i>;<i> 1967: Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East</i>; <i>Simon Wiesenthal</i>; and <i>One Palestine, Complete</i> (chosen one of ten best books of 2000 by <i>The New York Times</i>).</p><p><b>Haim Watzman</b> is a Jerusalem-based writer, journalist, and translator. He is the author, most recently, of <i>Necessary Stories</i>, a collection of short fiction. His previous books are <i>Company C: An American&#x2019;s Life as a Citizen-Soldier in Israel</i> (FSG, 2005) and <i>A Crack in the Earth: A Journey Up Israel&#x2019;s Rift Valley</i> (FSG, 2007).</p><p>"Segev . . . has spent four decades exploring Ben-Gurion&#x2019;s impact on Israel, in a body of work that has no equal either for the brilliance of his storytelling or the ironies of his analysis. He is neither a sentimental apologist for Ben-Gurion nor a crusading dethroner in the style of the New Historians with whom he has often been grouped. He is, rather, a student of power, and is at once fascinated and horrified by what he sees." <b>&#x2015;Adam Shatz, <i>London Review of Books</i></b></p><p>"[A] deeply researched, engrossing and, in some respects, controversial biography . . .

Doug Jones' prosecution of the last living bombers. </b></p><p>On September 15, 1963, the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama was bombed. The blast killed four young girls and injured twenty-two others. The FBI suspected four particularly radical Ku Klux Klan members. Yet due to reluctant witnesses, a lack of physical evidence, and pervasive racial prejudice the case was closed without any indictments.</p><p>But as Martin Luther King, Jr. famously expressed it, "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." Years later, Alabama Attorney General William Baxley reopened the case, ultimately convicting one of the bombers in 1977. Another suspect passed away in 1994, and US Attorney Doug Jones tried and convicted the final two in 2001 and 2002, representing the correction of an outrageous miscarriage of justice nearly forty years in the making. Jones himself went on to win election as Alabama&#x2019;s first Democratic Senator since 1992 in a dramatic race against Republican challenger Roy Moore.<br><i></i><br><i>Bending Toward Justice</i> is a dramatic and compulsively readable account of a key moment in our long national struggle for equality, related by an author who played a major role in these events. A distinguished work of legal and personal history, the book is destined to take its place as a canonical civil rights history.</p></p><p>Doug Jones is a US Senator who has made finding common ground a hallmark of his tenure. In 2017, he became the first Democrat to win a Senate election in Alabama since 1992. As U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama from 1997 to 2001, Jones prosecuted two former Ku Klux Klan members for their roles in the racially-motivated 1963 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing that took the lives of four girls. He also secured an indictment against Centennial Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph.<p>&#x201c;For 40 years, justice had gone undone in the brutal murder of four young girls in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. Forty years of pain and hurt for the families of those young girls and their community. Forty years of the Klan laughing at justice, getting away with the act of a coward. Doug Jones said no more. Justice had to be done. Those young girls deserved it. Their families deserved it. The community needed it. It took courage, commitment, and persistence. And&#x2015;maybe most of all&#x2015;heart.&#x201d; &#x2015;former vice president Joe Biden</p><p>&#x201c;This book describes the painful sacrifice that was required, and may be called for again, for us to move toward true democracy in America.

There are myriad competing theories, from the idea that aging is a simple wear and tear process, like the rusting of a car, to the belief that aging and death are genetically programmed and controlled. In fact, there is no clearly defined limit to life, and no single, predictable program playing itself out: different things are happening within and between tissues, and each system or organ accumulates damage at its own pace, according to the kind of insults imposed on it by daily living.</p><p>Sometime before 2020, the number of people over sixty-five worldwide will, for the first time, be greater than the number of 0-4 year olds; and by 2050 there are likely to be 2.5 times as many older people in the world as toddlers. Sue Armstrong tells the story of society's quest to understand aging through the eyes of the scientists themselves, as well as through the "ordinary" people who exemplify the mysteries of ageing--from those who suffer from the premature aging condition, Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, to people still running marathons in their 80s. </p><p><i>Borrowed Time </i>will investigate such mind-boggling experiments as transfusing young blood into old rodents, and research into transplanting the first human head, among many others. It will explore where science is taking us and what issues are being raised from a psychological, philosophical and ethical perspective, through interviews with, and profiles of, key scientists in the field and the people who represent interesting and important aspects of aging.</p></p><p><b>Sue Armstrong</b> is a science writer and broadcaster based in Edinburgh.

Who decides who gets to be a star? What are the privileges and pleasures of fandom? Do celebrities ever deserve the outsized attention they receive?</p><p>In this fascinating and deeply researched book, Sharon Marcus challenges everything you thought you knew about our obsession with fame. Icons are not merely famous for being famous; the media alone cannot make or break stars; fans are not simply passive dupes. Instead, journalists, the public, and celebrities themselves all compete, passionately and expertly, to shape the stories we tell about celebrities and fans. The result: a high-stakes drama as endless as it is unpredictable.</p><p>Drawing on scrapbooks, personal diaries, and vintage fan mail, Marcus traces celebrity culture back to its nineteenth-century roots, when people the world over found themselves captivated by celebrity chefs, bad-boy poets, and actors such as the &#x201c;divine&#x201d; Sarah Bernhardt (1844&#x2013;1923), as famous in her day as the Beatles in theirs. Known in her youth for sleeping in a coffin, hailed in maturity as a woman of genius, Bernhardt became a global superstar thanks to savvy engagement with her era&#x2019;s most innovative media and technologies: the popular press, commercial photography, and speedy new forms of travel.</p><p>Whether you love celebrity culture or hate it, <i>The Drama of Celebrity</i> will change how you think about one of the most important phenomena of modern times.</p></p><p>In this engaging history of celebrity culture from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, Sharon Marcus argues that the drama of celebrity depends on the interactions of three equally powerful groups: the media, the public, and celebrities themselves.<b>Sharon Marcus</b> is the Orlando Harriman Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.

Writers from Homer to Heaney instruct us in the art of mental composition, even as their poems progress. Just as painters understand paint, composers musical instruments, and sculptors stone or metal, verbal artists understand the only material in which their creations will get made--the back-lit tissue of the human brain. In her brilliant synthesis of literary criticism, philosophy, and cognitive psychology, Elaine Scarry explores the principal practices by which writers bring things to life for their readers.</p></p><p><p>"Part reverie, part rhapsody, and lucid analysis throughout."<b>--Robert Fagles, translator of Homer's <i>Iliad</i></b></p><p>"I finished <i>Dreaming by the Book</i> feeling that fundamental aspects of the nature of consciousness had been peeled open and exposed to view."<b>--Stephen M.

As long-held beliefs on love, faith, and God are challenged by the aggregate of changes that have overhauled our world, many of us are left feeling confused and uncertain while old norms are challenged and redefined at breakneck speed.<br><br>In <i>Wrestling with God</i>, Ronald Rolheiser offers a steady and inspiring voice to help us avow and understand our faith in a world where nothing seems solid or permanent. Drawing from his own life experience, as well as a storehouse of literary, psychological, and theological insights, the beloved author of <i>Sacred Fire </i>examines the fears and doubts that challenge us. It is in these struggles to find meaning, that Rolheiser lays out a path for faith in a world struggling to find faith, but perhaps more important, he helps us find our own rhythm within which to walk that path.</p><p>RONALD ROLHEISER, O.M.I., is a specialist in the fields of spirituality and systematic theology. His regular column in the <i>Catholic Herald</i> is featured in newspapers in five different countries. He is the author of the prizewinning <i>The Restless Heart</i> as well as <i>Forgotten Amongst the Lilies</i>.Preface<br><br>In 1970 Alvin Toffler wrote a book called <i>Future Shock</i>, in which he argued that a person born in the year 1900 who lived until 1970 would see more changes in his or her life than someone who had lived through the previous nineteen hundred years. Hard to believe, but no doubt true.<br><br>But Toffler wrote that book nearly fifty years ago. The last few decades have brought about changes in our lives that we could not even have imagined in the 1970s. The Internet and an ever-exploding information technology have put a smartphone or a computer into the hands of almost everyone on this planet. Thousands of television channels and more than a billion websites bring the whole world to our living rooms and bedrooms. Globalization has reshaped virtually all of our communities in terms of ethnicity, culture, and religion. The ever-evolving sexual revolution has radically altered how our world sees love,&nbsp;commitment, marriage, and family. Political and religious extremism polarizes our communities and countries and encourages us to live in fear. Both faith and church attendance have fallen sharply in the last eighty years, leaving more people uncertain about what they believe in and fewer people walking through church doors.<br><br>We are like pioneers settling a new world nobody has lived in before. Our task, of course, is not just to survive, but to somehow thrive, flourish, and find meaning, happiness, and, not least, faith&#x2014;something to believe in and to commit ourselves to in a world where nothing seems solid or permanent.<br><br>This quest sets before us a whole range of new challenges in terms of how we understand life, love, sexuality, family, country, religion, faith, and God. Traditionally, people looked to their churches for guidance on how to meet new challenges. Today, for all kinds of reasons, both good and bad, fewer people are turning to religion for answers. A certain distrust of churches seems to be part of our cultural ethos, and so more people are leaning on their own instincts and resources to sort through life&#x2019;s big questions.<br><br>For the most part this search is honest, but seeking the road of faith and meaning without the classical road maps is fraught with almost insurmountable obstacles, namely, a culture that too easily surrenders to personal comfort, narcissism, greed, grandiosity, paranoia, fear, exclusivity, bitterness, unforgiveness, superficiality, pseudosophistication, blindness to inequality, and an empirical view of reality. For too many people today, nothing is under-the-counter, and mystery and faith are either ignored or viewed negatively as a na�vet�. But we all need a faith, so in such a situation ideologies of all sorts quickly fill the void and become our faith. Sadly, we are mostly blind to this fact and, more unfortunate still, we unconsciously sacralize these ideologies with the exact reverence and obedience that a real faith asks of us. Soon enough they become our religion.<br><br>I say this sympathetically. We&#x2019;re not a bad people. In our intent, we&#x2019;re sincere, but no ideology carries the wisdom, balance, and challenge found in the great religious traditions, in the scriptures, in Jesus, and in what is best in our churches. A faith journey without a road map can lead us to many dead ends. God, of course, is infinitely patient and will no doubt look upon us when we have missed yet another turn and with forebearance say, &#x201c;Recalculating!&#x201d; My faith believes that all honest people will eventually find their way home, but I also believe that we can avoid a lot of blind alleys by seeking guidance from the deep wells of religious tradition. We have made ourselves religious orphans, partly out of sincerity and partly out of pride, and this has landed us in a place where we no longer have a belief, a faith, or a narrative big enough to give us hope beyond simple optimism.<br><br>I attempt in this book to provide a certain compass, a&nbsp;road map, a GPS, to help us in our search for not only meaning and faith but also simply a greater steadiness in life. It is written from a Christian perspective, but you needn&#x2019;t be a Christian or even a person of explicit faith to read it and be open to its counsel. Faith is not to be confused with ideas about faith. Faith is deeper than religion and should not be identified with any one creed. As Jesus himself says, those who do the will of God on earth are the ones who have real faith. An explicit faith is not always needed to get to heaven or to attain happiness this side of eternity. Yet the great religious traditions still offer invaluable insight into how we might journey in faith and go about searching for life, meaning, steadiness, and flourishing.<br><br>This book was written with three audiences in mind: those who are unsure of what they believe in but are searching for meaning, steadiness, and some kind of faith to live by; religious persons who are wrestling with the answers that their churches once gave them, are finding them lacking, but still want those same answers to meet the challenges of their present lives; and those who want to deepen their faith and enter more deliberately and intentionally into the more adult challenges into which authentic faith invites us.<br><br>Real faith is not a set of answers; rather, it leaves us in mystery, in longing, in desire, but open to something bigger. Real faith gets us in touch with what the poet Anne&nbsp;Sexton once called that &#x201c;gnawing pestilential rat&#x201d; inside us. Our deepest desire is a gnawing disquiet inside us, a longing for Someone big enough to embrace our questions and hold our doubts.<br><br>Ronald Rolheiser <br>San Antonio, Texas <br>August 1, 2017</p><h2>Ottolenghi Jerusalem /anglais</h2><p>Features recipes from within the cultural and religious melting pot of Jerusalem.

Citing examples from around the country, he calls for the restoration of traditional architecture, the introduction of enduring design principles in urban planning, and the development of public spaces that acknowledge our need to interact comfortable with one another.</p><p>Through magazine articles and through his previous book, <i>The Geography of Nowhere</i>, James Howard Kunstler has become one of the foremost decriers of the blighted urban landscape of the United States. Now, in this new sequel to the earlier book, Kunstler moves from description to prescription. The villains, Kunstler says, are zoning laws, real estate taxes, modernist architecture, and, particularly, the automobile. The solutions include multi-use zoning districts, car-free urban cores, revised tax laws, Beaux-Arts design principles, and, in particular, the neo-traditionalist school of architecture and city planning known as "new urbanism." It's possible to disagree with some of Kunstler's conclusions--the hope that large numbers of commuters will give up their single-passenger vehicles for public transit downtown has been discredited in city after city--without abandoning his larger goal: a return to a saner urban geography and, with it, to a saner way of life.James Howard Kunstler is a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> and is the author of eight novels. He now lives in Saratoga Springs, New York.</p><h2>The Earth Shall Teach Thee: The Lifework of an Amateur Artist</h2><p>President Boyd K. Packer is well known for his years of service as a teacher and leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Many would say that his greatest contribution has been that of a teacher. His ability to teach principles with simple everyday examples is a gift. This gift came as a natural ability but has been refined by years of study, practice, and prayer. But what most people don t know is that President Packer has had a pastime of painting and carving. This hobby has been used to beautify his home, teach his children, and provide needed relaxation. While he was painting or carving, his mind was carving out a sermon. He has created what some describe as masterpieces. To him, they are simply an attempt to capture the beauty of nature. He has modeled clay, carved wood, and used oil, acrylic, watercolor, pastels, charcoal, crayon, ink, and pencil. The collection covers seventy-seven years of effort, beginning in 1933 at age nine. His carvings of life-size birds in natural habitats are perhaps the apex of his artistic creations. Of more enduring worth, however, are the valuable lessons taught through his art, illustrations, parables, and example. At the heart of both his art and teachings is light.</p><p>President Boyd K. Packer, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, has been a member of that quorum since 1970, and a General Authority since 1961. Prior to that, he was the supervisor of seminaries and institutes for the Church. He was also a pilot in the U.S. Air Force during World War II, and he later received his doctorate in education from BYU. He served as president of the New England Mission. President Packer is the author of several bestselling books. He and his wife, Donna Edith Smith, are the parents of ten children.</p><h2>A Home for Mr. Emerson</h2><p>From the award-winning creators of THOSE REBELS, JOHN &amp; TOM, a joyful portrait of an American icon and an inspiring blueprint for how to live your life.<br><br>"All life is an experiment.<br> The more<br> experiments you make<br> the better."<br><br>Before Ralph Waldo Emerson was a great writer, he was a city boy who longed for the broad, open fields and deep, still woods of the country, and then a young man who treasured books, ideas, and people. When he grew up and set out in the world, he wondered, could he build a life around these things he loved?<br><br>This moving biography--presented with Barbara Kerley and Edwin Fotheringham's inimitable grace and style--illustrates the rewards of a life well-lived, one built around personal passions: creativity and community, nature and friendship.<br><br>May it inspire you to experiment and build the life you dream of living.</p><p>Barbara Kerley's award-winning biographies--including WHAT TO DO ABOUT ALICE?, THE EXTRAORDINARY MARK TWAIN (ACCORDING TO SUSY), and THOSE REBELS, JOHN &amp; TOM, illustrated by Edwin Fotheringham, and THE DINOSAURS OF WATERHOUSE HAWKINS and WALT WHITMAN: WORDS FOR AMERICA, both illustrated by Brian Selznick--are consistently praised for their lively prose, meticulous research, and artistic presentation style.

Edwin lives in Seattle, Washington. You can learn more about him online at www.edfotheringham.com.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;This introduction to the life of Ralph Waldo Emerson will help readers begin to understand the thoughts and values of this great American thinker. Emerson grows up in Boston, but yearns to make a life closer to nature where he can surround himself with books and friends. He finds a perfect home in Concord, Massachusetts, where he and his wife raise a family. Emerson eagerly becomes a part of the community, even playing the role of hog reeve, gathering up the town's runaway pigs. After collecting his thoughts in journals, Emerson begins traveling across the country to lecture, attracting visitors from around the world to his doorstep. A house fire later in his life devastates Emerson, but allows the town to demonstrate their affection for him as they rebuild his home. Emerson, who is likely little known to younger students, is brought to life in an approachable biography. The colorful depictions of Emerson are warm, cheerful, and full of movement. Children will love the cartoonlike illustrations that make Emerson seem like a superhero as he dives into oversized books and flies through the sky on another giant tome. Quotes from his writings are liberally used to illuminate moments of his life, allowing readers to get to know the man through his own words. The author's note provides further information about Emerson and his philosophy of thought. An eye-catching, kid-friendly biography that is a wonderful addition to any collection.&#x2014;Marian McLeod, Convent of the Sacred Heart, Greenwich, CT</p><h2>The Orphan&#39;s Tale: A Novel</h2><p><strong>Look out for Pam&#x2019;s new book, The Lost Girls of Paris, a story of friendship and courage centered around three women and a ring of female spies during World War II.</strong><br><br><strong><em>A New York Times bestseller!</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Readers who enjoyed Kristin Hannah&#x2019;s The Nightingale and Sara Gruen&#x2019;s Water for Elephants will embrace this novel. &#x201c; &#x2014;Library Journal<br><br>&#x201c;Secrets, lies, treachery, and passion....

This book looks at beliefs about the inside of the body and its functioning held in Greek and Roman society. It looks at the precarious position of the doctor in a culture where there was no set training and no form of qualification to prove the value of his treatments, and asks how a patient would respond to the different types of healing on offer. It discusses the medical practitioners, their ethical codes, and relationships with other areas of healing, such as religion. As well as covering the &#x2018;big names' of ancient medicine, such as Galen, the book considers the patients' experience, asking whether the drugs used would have worked, and explains how the theories doctors put forward were part of an attempt to account for symptoms and encourage a cure. The final chapters explore the later influence of ancient medicine, and the challenges to its authority posed by modern medicine.This is the first concise yet comprehensive and up-to-date study of Greek and Roman medicine, aimed at the non-specialist and written in a lively, engaging style.

All the James Bond novels and stories were written here. <p>This book explores the huge influence of Jamaica on the creation of Fleming&#x2019;s iconic post-war hero. The island was for Fleming part retreat from the world, part tangible representation of his own values, and part exotic fantasy. It will examine his Jamaican friendships&#x2015;his extraordinary circle included Errol Flynn, the Oliviers, international politicians and British royalty, as well as his close neighbor Noel Coward&#x2015;and trace his changing relationship with Ann Charteris (and hers with Jamaica) and the emergence of Blanche Blackwell as his Jamaican soulmate.</p><p><em>Goldeneye</em> also compares the real Jamaica of the 1950s during the build-up to independence with the island&#x2019;s portrayal in the Bond books, to shine a light on the attitude of the likes of Fleming and Coward to the dramatic end of the British Empire.</p> 16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Matthew Parker is the author of three previous non-fiction books, Monte Cassino: The Hardest-Fought Battle of World War II; the Los Angeles Times bestseller Panama Fever, which was one of the Washington Post&#x2019;s Best Books of the Year; and The Sugar Barons, which was an Economist Book of the Year. He lives in England.&#x201c;Parker&#x2019;s entertaining and well-researched biography dishes up a rich stew for fans of popular literature, travel writing, British and West Indian history, and filmmaking, all sauced with plenty of titillating celebrity gossip.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is no guilty pleasure. It&#x2019;s a straight-up delight of a biographical narrative that crisply illuminates Bond, Fleming and the era when the sun was setting on the British Empire and dawning on the jet age. Parker is out to explain an era, a writer and a remarkable character. Mission accomplished&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Dallas Morning News</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A wonderful biography. If you like Bond, you&#x2019;ll like this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Forbes</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fans of James Bond books and films, along with those intrigued by the man behind the spy will devour the captivating stories within these pages. Readers interested in Jamaica&#x2019;s relationship with Britain and America as the country moved toward independence will also appreciate the historical, cultural, and political realities and their context within Fleming&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Throughout Matthew Parker&#x2019;s account of Fleming&#x2019;s post-war sojourns in Jamaica, and how they shaped his fiction, we can imagine Bond himself looking on and feeling a perverse stab of envy. Parker tells a wider story; that of an island and its people at a turning point in their history. Parker&#x2019;s highly readable account of Fleming&#x2019;s Jamaican life is less <em>Thunderball</em> and more Jean Rhys&#x2019;s <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em>. Bond himself might have been a touch jealous.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Telegraph</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hugely enjoyable and deliciously gossipy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Telegraph</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Against a backdrop of the island&#x2019;s evolution from colonialism to independence, Matthew Parker tells the story of Fleming&#x2019;s Jamaican retreat, of the psychological fallout of the end of the British Empire and of how Bond parachuted in to offer solace in the form of escapist fantasy. With Goldeneye now a luxury resort and the public appetite for Bond movies undiminished, Parker&#x2019;s book is an astute reminder of the price we pay for fantasy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Matthew Parker&#x2019;s <em>Goldeneye</em> spies on Ian Fleming&#x2019;s love affair with Jamaica&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Vanity Fair (Hot Type Pick)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Unique. Parker's <em>Goldeneye</em> is an appealing Caribbean history dressed as pop culture, and he adds complexity to Bond's legacy of vodka martinis, car chases and women in bikinis.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Associated Press</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The author parallels Fleming's life with postwar events that planted the seed for the Bond character. He summarizes each of the Bond books as they reflect Cold War history&#x2015;e.g., the Suez Crisis, the independence movements and increasing economic turmoil. A well-written look at Fleming''s life, though the book is even better as an indictment of the anachronistic colonialism of the 1950s and the end of the British Empire.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus</em></strong></p><h2>Idols Behind Altars: Modern Mexican Art and Its Cultural Roots (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p>Art critic, historian and journalist Anita Brenner (1905-1974) is acknowledged to be one of the most important and perceptive writers on the art, culture, and political history of Mexico. <i>Idols Behind Altars</i> is her influential historical and critical study of modern Mexican art and its roots. It was one of the first books to afford Mexican art the same serious considerations as European and Asian art and remains indispensable for anyone interested in the subject. The works of such major figures as Diego Rivera, J�se Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Francisco Goitia and Jean Charlot are examined in the cultural context of pre-Columbian times through the 19th century. Brenner's astute analysis of Mexican history, her keen insights into revolutionary politics, and her passionate advocacy of Mexican art infuse this book with seminal importance. 117 illustrations &#x2014; including some early photographs by Edward Weston &#x2014; enhance the text.</p><p></p><h2>Big Sky River: An Anthology (The Parable Series, 3)</h2><p><strong>The &#x201c;First Lady of the West,&#x201d; #1 </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> bestselling author Linda Lael Miller, cordially invites you to Parable, Montana&#x2014;where love awaits</strong><br><br>Sheriff Boone Taylor has two kids he adores, his job, a run-down but decent ranch, two faithful dogs and a good horse.

Hollibaugh is a lesbian sex radical, ex-hooker, incest survivor, gypsy child, poor-white-trash, high femme dyke. She is also an award-winning filmmaker, feminist, Left political organizer, public speaker, and journalist. <i>My Dangerous Desires </i>presents over twenty years of Hollibaugh&#x2019;s writing, an introduction written especially for this book, and five new essays including &#x201c;A Queer Girl Dreaming Her Way Home,&#x201d; &#x201c;My Dangerous Desires,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sexuality, Labor, and the New Trade Unionism.&#x201d;<br> In looking at themes such as the relationship between activism and desire or how sexuality can be intimately tied to one&#x2019;s class identity, Hollibaugh fiercely and fearlessly analyzes her own political development as a response to her unique personal history. She explores the concept of labeling and the associated issues of categories such as butch or femme, transgender, bisexual, top or bottom, drag queen, b-girl, or drag king. The volume includes conversations with other writers, such as Deirdre English, Gayle Rubin, Jewelle Gomez, and Cherr�e Moraga. From the groundbreaking article &#x201c;What We&#x2019;re Rollin&#x2019; Around in Bed With&#x201d; to the radical &#x201c;Sex Work Notes: Some Tensions of a Former Whore and a Practicing Feminist,&#x201d; Hollibaugh charges ahead to describe her reality, never flinching from the truth. Dorothy Allison&#x2019;s moving foreword pays tribute to a life lived in struggle by a working-class lesbian who, like herself, refuses to suppress her dangerous desires.<br> Having informed many of the debates that have become central to gay and lesbian activism, Hollibaugh&#x2019;s work challenges her readers to speak, write, and record their desires&#x2014;especially, perhaps, the most dangerous of them&#x2014;&#x201c;in order for us all to survive.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Sex radical Amber L. Hollibaugh may be best known for the classic "What We're Rollin' Around in Bed With," the edited transcript of a taped 1979 conversation on butch/femme desire between Hollibaugh and Cherrie Moraga. This influential article, steeped in the lesbian feminist lingo of the 1970s, still reads almost as a confession, in which socially and economically disadvantaged women--both ardent feminists and one of them an ex-hooker--nervously admit to each other the polarity of their sexual needs. This article showcases the great strengths of Hollibaugh's work: courage and insistence on the truth. The most moving essay in <i>My Dangerous Desires</i>, which covers work of the past two decades, is a memoir and meditation on aging called "Femme Fables" (a collection of three shorter pieces from Hollibaugh's column in the <i>New York Native</i> in the early 1980s), in which she recalls returning to her working-class home after a year away at an upper-class boarding school. She had brought back a suitcase of books, to which her parents responded with awe and respect. One day she came home to find her mother sitting on her bed, crying, surrounded by these open books, unable to understand them. Years later, Hollibaugh admits: <blockquote> This is a pain I cannot avoid each time I sit at my typewriter or assemble my office. The ghost of her narrowed options and all the dreams she had to defer to me, the confusions and bitter separation between us, are shapes which hang in my house now and live with me. In order to give me a chance, my parents had to create a child they did not understand; they had to endure my shame of them. The pride we carry about each other is surrounded by a sadness none of us can dissolve. </blockquote> While some of the political debates that inspired these pieces are happily out of date, this remains a rich and evocative collection, offering bulletins from the battlefields of the feminist sex wars. <i>--Regina Marler</i>&#x201c;I welcome you to my friend&#x2019;s essays, to the unique sharp-eyed glance of a woman who had to fight to be able to say, &#x2018;I want.&#x2019; In Amber&#x2019;s life, desire has been made sacred. Whether she is writing about the female body, the femme psyche, or the fearful need to admit desire itself, Amber has vindicated all our lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dorothy Allison, from the Foreword <p>&#x201c;Amber Hollibaugh is a brilliant activist intellectual from trailer park America.Her particular queer working-class life has taught her the skills, risks and pleasures of radically changing society-and social movements&#x2014;from their despised edges. We&#x2019;re lucky she hasn&#x2019;t kept this dangerous knowledge a secret. For years her written and spoken words have made history.

And of the English editions, none can equal this inspiring translation by Bishop Richard Challoner.<p>This book speaks to the soul of every true Christian, reminding us of the fleeting nature of earthly joy as opposed to the eternity of happiness with God.</p><p>The guide of the saints since it first appeared in 1418, it was the sole spiritual reading of St. Therese of Lisieux, who loved it and knew it by heart.<br><br> Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange asserted that the true mysticism of which it speaks is accessible to all, if they are willing to follow the way of humility, the cross, continual prayer, and docility to the Holy Ghost.</p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Thomas � Kempis fan club includes St. Ignatius, Thomas Merton, Thomas More, and even Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. (She reads a chapter of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> every night before sleep.) <i>Imitation</i> has exerted immense influence on Christian worship, ethics, and church structure, because it gives specific yet broad-minded guidance about the central task of Christian life--learning to live like Jesus. Better to read this book a little here and there, now and then, than to try gobbling it cover to cover. <i>Imitation</i> is no triumph of orderly thinking, but it's a great monument and incentive to deep living. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>When does a classic become new, fresh and extremely relevant? When someone takes it out of an outdated format and makes it readable, searchable and understandable. The Imitation of Christ has been in print for over 500 years for a good reason. It is powerful, beautiful and heart piercing. James Watkins has taken those words and reworked them into ninety daily readings, arranged by topic. Whether for daily devotions or for sound insight into a particular issue, Watkins paraphrase blends the ancient with the modern to introduce this classic to a new audience, speaking to all Christians with credibility and authority and using inclusive language not found in the original.</p><h2>The Bookshop on the Shore: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A grand baronial house on Loch Ness, a quirky small-town bookseller, and a single mom looking for a fresh start all come together in this witty and warm-hearted novel by <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Jenny Colgan.<br></strong><br></p><p>Desperate to escape from London, single mother Zoe wants to build a new life for herself and her four year old son Hari.&nbsp;She can barely afford the crammed studio apartment on a busy street where shouting football fans keep them awake all night.

At once collage, diary, memoir and annotated scrapbook, it felt miraculous then and still does. With fearless imagination and formal daring, Adrienne Kennedy has given us A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman and an American literary classic." --Margo Jefferson<br><br>"Adrienne Kennedy has introduced a new form of black autobiography, one that, like her plays, will be widely imitated. Like most great artists in whose work different cultures and styles converge, she is unique." --Ishmael Reed<br><br>"Just as her brilliant plays changed what was possible on the stage, Adrienne Kennedy's autobiography transformed the form. Written with a poet's insight and a dramatist's sense of form, Kennedy's autobiography is a classic--one that not only illuminates her singular work, but the world and politics that made her." --Hilton Als<br>As the bittersweet recollections of a young black growing up in Ohio in the 1940s, aspiring to be a famous writer, this scrapbook suffers from its deliberately fragmented format. Kennedy, whose Funnyhouse of a Negro won a 1964 Obie Award, seems to be adapting here the nonlinear style of her avant-garde plays. Hundreds of very short, titled entries ("Junior High," "My Father," "Paul Robeson," "Frank Sinatra") add up to a jumbled self-portrait of a writer slowly finding her direction. She also presents a compendium of creative artists, famous people, friends and relatives who in any way influenced her work. We get scores of brief entries on Bette Davis, Marlon Brando, Beethoven, Richard Wright, Jackson Pollock, Chopin, Duke Ellington, Socrates and dozens more. Readers with an abiding interest in Kennedy's dramatic output may find this encyclopedic approach worth the effort. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Human Soul and its Relations with Other Spirits</h2><p>&#x201c;There is nothing deeper, nothing kinder, nothing more merciful than Catholic theology on the human soul. It is the oldest and most persevering sentiment, combined with the highest and most exact thought.&#x201d; So writes Abbot Vonier in this dynamic and illuminating study of the human spirit. <p> Following the teachings of the Catholic Church and St. Thomas Aquinas, Vonier expounds the greatness of the human soul, its destiny and glory, its association with the angels and God, its union with the body, and the tragedy of losing one&#x2019;s soul through sin. This work, which is at once philosophical and mystical, stimulates the mind and heart to a deep contemplation and love for the God who created in man a spiritual soul like to himself.</p><p> &#x201c;There are those who regard <i>The Human Soul</i> as the Abbot&#x2019;s best work. ... For [Vonier], the writing of books was part of his priestly activity. ... The book is a study of man both in light of reason and the higher splendor of divine revelation. In that medium, man is seen to be, in St. Augustine&#x2019;s magnificent phrase, &#x2018;an earthly being, but one fit for heaven.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Dom Ernest Graf, in <i>Anscar Vonier: Abbot of Buckfast</i></p></p><p>Dom Anscar Vonier, Abbot of Buckfast, was among England&#x2019;s greatest homilists and theologians of the early twentieth century.

[It] is not a book for children, nostalgic or otherwise."&#x2015;Loren Baritz, <em>The Nation</em></strong></p> William Appleman Williams was one of America&#x2019;s greatest critics of US imperialism. <em>The Contours of American History</em>, first published in 1961, reached back to seventeenth-century British history to argue that the relationship between liberalism and empire was in effect a grand compromise, with expansion abroad containing class and race tensions at home. Coming as it did before the political explosions of the 1960s, Williams&#x2019;s message was a deeply heretical one, and yet the Modern Library ultimately chose Contours as one of the best 100 nonfiction books of the 20th Century.</p><p>A former president of the Organization of American Historians, William Appleman Williams taught for many years at the University of Wisconsin and Oregon State University. His books include The Contours of American History, The Tragedy of American Diplomacy, and Empire as a Way of Life.&#x201c;One of the most original home-grown minds in American history.

Have you ever wished the magic were real? Welcome to <i>The Land of Laughs.</i> A novel about how terrifying that would be.</p><p>Schoolteacher Thomas Abbey, unsure son of a film star, doesn't know who he is or what he wants--in life, in love, or in his relationship with the strange and intense Saxony Gardner. What he knows is that in his whole life nothing has touched him so deeply as the novels of Marshall France, a reclusive author of fabulous children's tales who died at forty-four.</p><p>Now Thomas and Saxony have come to France's hometown, the dreamy Midwestern town of Galen, Missouri, to write France's biography. Warned in advance that France's family may oppose them, they're surprised to find France's daughter warmly welcoming instead. But slowly they begin to see that something fantastic and horrible is happening. The magic of Marshall France has extended far beyond the printed page...leaving them with a terrifying task to undertake.</p></p><p>Thomas Abbey is a man stuck in a rut. An English teacher in a small Connecticut prep school, Abbey is in a crisis. His career is unfulfilling, he has no social or love life to speak of, and he cannot break out of the shadow of his famous father, the actor Stephen Abbey. To kick-start his life, he takes a sabbatical to work on a biography of his favorite writer, Marshall France. France's books were the only thing that kept Abbey sane during his childhood, and though he was renowned for his lyrical and imaginative children's books, nearly nothing was known about the writer's life.<p> Although Abbey has been warned that France's daughter Anna has blocked all previous attempts at her father's biography, he and Saxony Garder--an intense woman also obsessed with France's life--head to Galen, Missouri, with high hopes of breaking down Anna's resistance. They are surprised to find Anna the soul of small-town hospitality and quite excited about Abbey's proposal--even eager to get the project finished as soon as possible. Even stranger than Anna's behavior is the town of Galen itself. On the surface, all is as a small midwestern town should be. But the people of the town seem to know what their future holds--freak accidents and all--down to the hour and are as eager for Abbey to finish the biography as Anna is.</p><p> As far as plot goes, <i>The Land of Laughs</i> doesn't break any new ground--it is a riff on a very old literary theme--and the more interesting issues the story raises--fate, free will, and the creative power of the written word--receive only a glancing blow as the story careens to its somewhat unsatisfying Gothic ending. That said, Carroll does show a good ear for dialogue and a deft hand at creating complex characters and quietly ominous moods. And the story--hoary plot line and all--immediately grabs you and doesn't let go. If you already know Jonathan Carroll from his other novels, you will want to add this reissue of his first novel to your library. And if you haven't yet been introduced to this inventive author, <i>The Land of Laughs</i> is the perfect place to begin. <i>--Perry M. Atterberry</i></p><p><b>Jonathan Carroll</b> has written 13 novels, a short story collection, and a number of film scripts.

With a fresh commander, it was ready to demonstrate its true power: from Operation Argument in February&#x2015;targeting German aircraft production plants&#x2015;to bringing the Luftwaffe to battle over Berlin, the combined US Air Force-Royal Air Force forces&#x2019; round-the clock campaign bottled up the German army in Normandy.<br><br> Day after day, the American bomber boys watched their comrades burn to death in blazing bombers, or observed their comrades being thrown out of exploding aircraft without parachutes and sink with their crippled aircraft in the freezing North Sea. But by the following spring they had destroyed the Nazi&#x2019;s fighting spirit and saw Germany broken in two.<br><br> In this authoritative history, Kevin Wilson reveals the blood and heroism of the 8th Air Force.

"He wrote for the day, the moment; but these are just the writers whom posterity is apt to put into its pocket." </b><br><br>Considered by contemporary critics to be Trollope's greatest novel, <i>The Way We Live Now</i> is a satire of the literary world of London in the 1870s and a bold indictment of the new power of speculative finance in English life. "I was instigated by what I conceived to be the commercial profligacy of the age," Trollope said.&nbsp;His story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope knew well the difficulties of dealing with editors, publishers, reviewers, and the public; his portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements.<br><br>His picture of late nineteenth century England is of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy, where the traditional virtues of Tory squirearchy, represented by Roger Carbury, prove to be no match for the financial genius of Augustus Melmotte. In <i>The Way We Live Now</i> Trollope combines his talents as a portraitist and his skills as a storyteller to give us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

She kept forgetting that they were now officially &#x201c;engaged&#x201d; in the eyes of the world. Well, the small world of Granford, Massachusetts, at least&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t like she was announcing it in the <i>Boston Globe</i>. She didn&#x2019;t feel like a fianc�e, which she&#x2019;d always thought was an equally silly word. They hadn&#x2019;t gotten any closer to setting a date. They hadn&#x2019;t discussed where or when or how. They hadn&#x2019;t even worked out where they&#x2019;d live, though currently Seth was spending most of his time at her house, which made sense, since his office and storage space were in her barn. On the other hand, Meg also had her housemate to consider&#x2014;Briona Stewart, who was also Meg&#x2019;s orchard manager, and indispensable to keeping the apple orchard running. Given how little Meg could afford to pay, the position came with a free room, and she couldn&#x2019;t just toss Bree out into the local student-driven housing scene. There were many things Meg and Seth needed to talk about, maybe when they were less busy and exhausted&#x2014;she with the apple harvest, Seth with his fast-growing renovation business. Not the best time to make happy plans.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; Meg asked now. &#x201c;Did I miss something? What&#x2019;s going crazy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone in town wants to tear things down and put things up, all at once.&#x201d; Seth sighed. &#x201c;You have anything cold to drink?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. Water, iced tea, even some sports drink, if you want electrolytes.&#x201d; After a recent brush with heat exhaustion, Meg had been scrupulous about keeping plenty of liquids on hand. Since it was harvest season, she was also always reminding her pickers up in the orchard to stay hydrated, too.</p><p>Seth hauled himself up and got a bottle of water from the refrigerator. He sat and downed half the bottle. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. So, basically, I think everybody in town looked up, noticed it was September, and said, &#x2018;Hey, we&#x2019;d better get something done before winter.&#x2019; Of course, we could argue about whether there&#x2019;ll even be a winter this year, what with the weird weather we&#x2019;ve had. Or maybe there&#x2019;ll be a six-month winter.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg sipped her own drink. &#x201c;Back up&#x2014;who&#x2019;s &#x2018;everybody&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, first there&#x2019;s the library. Did you hear about the new one?&#x201d;</p><p>Meg racked her brain and came up blank. She hadn&#x2019;t had time to read the local paper since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. June? And it was only a weekly. She&#x2019;d been so busy for months, first with fighting the drought, which had meant a lot of hand-watering of her eighteen acres of apple trees; now with managing the harvest, which had begun in August and would run through November, depending on when the apples decided to ripen, which was kind of unpredictable. But a new library was a major step for Granford, Massachusetts, and she felt like she should have known. Besides, Seth, a town selectman, usually kept her up-to-date. &#x201c;Uh, no?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you a concerned citizen!&#x201d; Seth joked. &#x201c;Okay, last year one of the old families in town donated a part of their property to the town to use to build a new library. It&#x2019;s out near the high school, on Route 202. Plenty of space for parking, and it&#x2019;s big enough to build what they want, assuming they can figure out how to pay for it. They&#x2019;ve already got some state grants, and the fund-raising is going well.&#x201d; He stopped to drink some more water. &#x201c;The building site is set back pretty far from the road, so you might not have noticed it if you drove past it. But there was a formal ground-breaking a few months ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry I missed it. Should I make a contribution? But building a new library doesn&#x2019;t sound at all crazy to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not finished,&#x201d; Seth said. &#x201c;Then there&#x2019;s the Historical Society.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are they doing?&#x201d; Meg asked. Now, the Historical Society <i>was </i>someplace she was involved with. They owned a nice but too-small one-story building that faced the village green, just down the hill from the church. When she&#x2019;d first visited almost two years ago now, as a newcomer to Granford, it had been an unheated space filled with a hodgepodge of unrelated collections. She wasn&#x2019;t surprised that the director, Gail Selden, had bigger plans. Gail had also become a friend, and had helped Meg more than once to find information about her own eighteenth-century home. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me they&#x2019;re moving!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not that,&#x201d; Seth replied. &#x201c;They own that building outright, but as you&#x2019;ve probably noticed, it needs work. And it&#x2019;s not really big enough to serve the public the way they&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;</p><p>That was true. Gail had worked wonders cleaning it up and creating exhibits that made sense, but it was still small and unheated.</p><p>Seth went on, &#x201c;The Society has collections stashed all over town, wherever they could find storage space, and Gail really wants to get them all under one roof. But still the same old roof.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So what are they planning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Basically, they had two choices: build up or build down. The Historical Society board didn&#x2019;t want to change the profile of the building by adding another story, even a partial one, so they&#x2019;ve decided to dig out under the building.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow&#x2014;that sounds ambitious. Is it even possible?&#x201d; Meg got up to help herself to another bottle of water, laying an affectionate hand on Seth&#x2019;s shoulder as she passed. She was still getting used to having him around more or less full-time, but with their busy schedules, it was nice when they saw each other at all. &#x201c;Want another?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; He laid his hand over hers, briefly. &#x201c;They have an architect who says it&#x2019;s possible, if it&#x2019;s done carefully, of course. At least it&#x2019;s not too big a building. They&#x2019;d have to put supports under the existing building, then excavate, then pour a foundation and finish the space so it can be used for document and collections storage, which means special considerations for moisture and ventilation. Oh, and Gail really wants a bathroom in the building for staff and volunteers.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg laughed. &#x201c;I can certainly understand that!&#x201d; While her own colonial house had four bedrooms, it had only one bath, which really wasn&#x2019;t enough with three people living in the house&#x2014;especially when they all needed showers at the same time after a working day. She had to keep reminding herself that when the house had been built by one of her Warren family ancestors, there had been <i>no</i> indoor plumbing beyond the well in the basement, which had provided water for the kitchen above by way of an old hand pump. But standards for personal hygiene had been different then. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the time frame there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday,&#x201d; Seth said. &#x201c;Seriously, they want to get it roughed out before the ground freezes, so it&#x2019;s a pretty ambitious schedule. But they more or less have the money in hand, so they don&#x2019;t want to wait.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They do?&#x201d; Having money in hand was an unusual situation for most historical societies.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. The Society also owns the house across the street, which they rent out for income, and Gail told me that when they talked to a financial advisor he told them that they could take out a mortgage on the rental house, and voil�! They&#x2019;d have the cash for the renovations. The rent gives them enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Once they figured out how much money they had to work with, then they started thinking about building plans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m impressed. So, that&#x2019;s the library and the Historical Society&#x2014;are you finished yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not quite. There&#x2019;s also a school building that needs some serious work, and nobody can decide whether to try to fix it&#x2014;with state money&#x2014;or to tear it down and start over. So we put together a committee to study it, but there&#x2019;s a deadline coming up shortly.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I really am out of the loop</i>, Meg thought. Of course, not having any children, she hadn&#x2019;t paid much attention to school-related issues, but still. &#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Almost. This is off the record, but the town is also thinking about selling the town hall building.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? I like that building!&#x201d; Meg protested.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lovely structure, but a lousy municipal building. It was built as a private summer home at the height of the Victorian era. The wiring isn&#x2019;t up to code, so it&#x2019;s hard to use computers and printers and the like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where would the town administration go? Is there some other building that would work? Or do they want to build, too?&#x201d;</p><p>Seth shook his head. &#x201c;Not clear. They might be able to move into the old library when the new one opens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This really is a game of musical chairs, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Meg said. &#x201c;Where do you stand on all of these? I mean, you&#x2019;re a selectman, so in a sense, you are the town, or part of it.&#x201d; Meg knew there were only three members on the select board, plus a town manager. Who voted to approve projects like these?</p><p>Seth leaned back in his chair and stretched. &#x201c;Caught right in the middle. The library and the Historical Society have their own funding, so they don&#x2019;t need our approval, apart from permitting and inspections and such. The school project does, and obviously selling town hall would. Theoretically, I&#x2019;m in favor of all and any of these, as long as the financial numbers make sense and they meet all construction requirements&#x2014;which could be challenging, at least for the Historical Society.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you going to be personally involved?&#x201d; Meg asked. When she&#x2019;d first met Seth, he&#x2019;d been managing his family&#x2019;s plumbing business, but his real love was building restoration and renovation. Although plumbing was a good fallback when no one could afford historically accurate renovations to their older homes.</p><p>&#x201c;If I had my choice, I&#x2019;d help out with the Historical Society project. It&#x2019;s an interesting challenge, and I&#x2019;d like to be sure they retain the historic character of the building. As you know as well as I do, when you start jerking around an old building, you always end up finding other things you need to fix, like rotting sills or termite damage. And if they&#x2019;re putting in an HVAC system&#x2014;which, by the way, would be a first in that building&#x2014;there are issues of windows and insulation and making the building more airtight while still keeping it authentic, at least in appearance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t have to vote on that project, so there&#x2019;s no conflict,&#x201d; Meg mused, almost to herself.</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly. The library doesn&#x2019;t need me, and the school project probably wouldn&#x2019;t either. The town hall question is anybody&#x2019;s guess. So that leaves the Historical Society. By the way, I pointed Gail toward an architect who specializes in this kind of project, so they&#x2019;ve already got plans in hand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can it be done before winter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a tight schedule, but it could work, if everything goes well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And if it doesn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We seal it up as best we can and hope for a mild winter. At least the collections will be stored off-site.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of the collections, I know she&#x2019;s got more documents about this house that I&#x2019;d love to see, but I haven&#x2019;t had the time. Maybe when the harvest is over.&#x201d; Winter, Meg knew from last year&#x2014;her first as an apple grower&#x2014;was the slowest time for the orchard. She&#x2019;d have some long days to fill.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the harvest going?&#x201d;</p><p>Meg shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a lot to compare it to other than last year, but Bree says we&#x2019;re doing okay. We were lucky that the drought broke when it did. Another couple of weeks and we&#x2019;d have lost a lot of apples.&#x201d; <i>Along with most of my very thin profit margin</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Everything working out with the pickers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So far. Most of the regulars are back, bless them, although we lost one to a competitor over in Belchertown who could offer a little more money, and there are fewer and fewer people who want to do this kind of manual labor.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg was lucky that although <i>she</i> was new to running an orchard, the orchard itself was well established, and in recent years had been overseen by the local state university. Which was also how she&#x2019;d come to employee Bree, a recent graduate of the university who&#x2019;d studied orchard management. The fact that Bree was Jamaican-born also helped her in managing the mainly Jamaican pickers who had been working the orchards in the Connecticut River Valley for generations&#x2014;at least it helped once they got used to the idea of working for a woman, and a young one at that, and one who&#x2019;d spent most of her life actually living in Massachusetts rather than Jamaica. But Bree had earned their respect and things were going smoothly; the loss of that one picker was in no way her fault. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why Bree and I are both up there most days, just to fill in. It&#x2019;s hard to know in advance from week to week what&#x2019;s going to be ripe, and sometimes we get swamped. Plus, it&#x2019;s demanding work. Thank goodness the new trees we planted in the spring won&#x2019;t be bearing for a couple more years. Maybe by then I&#x2019;ll have figured out how this all works.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you take a short break tomorrow? I&#x2019;m going to talk to Gail about the excavation process in the morning, if you want to tag along.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to see Gail, and this project sounds really interesting. I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ve got a lot on the schedule for tomorrow, so I can probably sneak away. But I&#x2019;ll have to check with Bree.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You talking about me?&#x201d; Bree came in through the back door.</p><p>&#x201c;May I take an hour or two off tomorrow morning, please, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; Meg said, smiling. &#x201c;The Historical Society is planning to add a basement under their building, and I&#x2019;m curious to see how they&#x2019;re going to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Bree rummaged in the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of water. &#x201c;I guess. We&#x2019;re just about caught up with the Cortlands and the Empires, but the Galas aren&#x2019;t ready yet and we&#x2019;re waiting on the Baldwins. Did you order the new crates?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, shoot, I forgot.&#x201d; The old wooden crates that Meg had inherited when she moved into the house were wearing out fast, and they&#x2019;d been replacing them as needed with more modern plastic ones. Not nearly as pretty, but much more practical. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that in the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you have my blessing for the morning&#x2014;<i>after</i> you place that order,&#x201d; Bree said in a mock-serious tone. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening with dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not a clue,&#x201d; Meg replied. &#x201c;Seth, you have any ideas?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a new pizza place in the shopping center on 202. Want to try that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did I ever miss seeing that? Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>The pizza last night had been good, and Meg sent up a silent cheer that Granford had one more place that served food. The only &#x201c;real&#x201d; restaurant in town, Gran&#x2019;s, was more upscale, though far from fancy. Meg loved eating there, especially since she&#x2019;d had a hand in creating the place, and even more so because she now counted the owners, Nicky and Brian Czarnecki, as friends, but she wasn&#x2019;t always in the mood for a sit-down meal. A pizza place, and one only a mile or two from her house, was a great quick-and-dirty alternative.</p><p>When she awoke the next morning, Meg checked the clock, then rolled over and nudged Seth. &#x201c;Hey, what time are you meeting Gail?&#x201d;</p><p>He answered without opening his eyes. &#x201c;As soon as she gets the kids off to school. What time is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seven.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth opened his eyes, then sat up quickly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to get some paperwork together before...</p></p><h2>Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes</h2><p>Before New Journalism, before the waggish cinema of Woody Allen, before the Gonzo World of Hunter S.

This is the America to which Julian West, a young Bostonian, awakens after more than a century of sleep. West's initial sense of wonder, his gradual acceptance of the new order and a new love, and Bellamy's wonderful prophetic inventions - electric lighting, shopping malls, credit cards, electronic broadcasting - ensured the mass popularity of this 1888 novel. But however rich in fantasy and romance, Looking Backward is a passionate attach on the social ills of nineteenth-century industrialism and a plea for social reform and moral renewal. In her introduction, Cecelia Tichi discusses how the novel echoes the anguish and hopes of its own age while it embodies a sustaining myth of the American literary tradition-that man's perfectibility is attainable in the New World.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Speakers from diverse fields deliver concise talks aimed at challenging and inspiring Africans and friends of Africa. I had spoken at a different TED conference a few years before, giving a talk titled &#x2018;The Danger of the Single Story&#x2019; about how stereotypes limit and shape our thinking, especially about Africa. It seems to me that the word feminist, and the idea of feminism itself, is also limited by stereotypes. When my brother Chuks and best friend Ike, both co-organizers of the TEDxEuston conference, insisted that I speak, I could not say no. I decided to speak about feminism because it is something I feel strongly about. I suspected that it might not be a very popular subject, but I hoped to start a necessary conversation. And so that evening as I stood onstage, I felt as though I was in the presence of family &#x2013; a kind and attentive audience, but one that might resist the subject of my talk. At the end, their standing ovation gave me hope.<br>...<br>WE SHOULD ALL BE FEMINISTS&nbsp;<br><br>Okoloma was one of my greatest childhood friends. He lived on my street and looked after me like a big brother: if I liked a boy, I would ask Okoloma&#x2019;s opinion. Okoloma was funny and intelligent and wore cowboy boots that were pointy at the tips. In December 2005, in a plane crash in southern Nigeria, Okoloma died. It is still hard for me to put into words how I felt. Okoloma was a person I could argue with, laugh with and truly talk to. He was also the first person to call me a feminist.<br><br>I was about fourteen. We were in his house, arguing, both of us bristling with half- baked knowledge from the books we had read. I don&#x2019;t remember what this particular argument was about. But I remember that as I argued and argued, Okoloma looked at me and said, &#x2018;You know, you&#x2019;re a feminist.&#x2019;<br><br> It was not a compliment. I could tell from his tone &#x2013; the same tone with which a person would say, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re a supporter of terrorism.&#x2019;<br><br> I did not know exactly what this word feminist meant. And I did not want Okoloma to know that I didn&#x2019;t know. So I brushed it aside and continued to argue. The first thing I planned to do when I got home was look up the word in the dictionary.<br><br>Now fast-forward to some years later. In 2003, I wrote a novel called<i> Purple Hibiscus</i>, about a man who, among other things, beats his wife, and whose story doesn&#x2019;t end too well. While I was promoting the novel in Nigeria, a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man, told me he wanted to advise me. (Nigerians, as you might know, are very&nbsp;quick to give unsolicited <i>advice</i>.) <br><br>He told me that people were saying my&nbsp;novel was feminist, and his advice to me &#x2013; he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke &#x2013; was that I should never call myself a feminist, since feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands.<br><br> So I decided to call myself a Happy Feminist.</p><h2>The Hills Reply</h2><p><b>An intensely graceful novel recounting scenes of the Norwegian countryside from one of Norway's most beloved 20th-century writers.</b><br><br>Tarjei Vesaas's final work before his death, this episodic novel drifts between dream-like abstraction and vivid description of seemingly ordinary yet heightened scenes of the Norwegian countryside. The many overlapping, semi-autobiographical vignettes of <i>The Hills Reply</i> relate a deep appreciation for the complexity of the human condition, nature, and relationships.</p><p>Tarjei Vesaas (1897-1970) novelist, poet, and playwright, is widely regarded as one of Norway's greatest writers of the twentieth century. Vesaas spent the majority of his life in Vinje, living on the farmhouse that had belonged to his family for three centuries. Despite his apparent isolation, Vesaas proved to be a prolific writer, publishing twenty-five novels and several volumes of poetry, short stories, and plays in his lifetime. He won several awards, including the Gyldendal's endowment in 1943, The Nordic Council's Literature prize in 1963 for his novel, <i>The Ice Palace</i>, and the Venice Prize in 1953 for <i>The Winds</i>. His novel <i>Th</i>e <i>Birds </i>was published by Archipelago in 2016. He was considered for the Nobel Prize three times. <b>About the translator: </b>Elizabeth Rokkan was a professor of English at the University of Bergen, Norway from 1964 to 1990. She has received critical acclaim for her translations of the work of Tarjei Vesaas and Cora Sandel, and was awarded the St. Olav Medal for her efforts to make Norwegian literature available to English speakers."Vesaas writes beautifully about the natural world, but he presents it as a frequently harsh and brutal place. Early in the book, one character encounters a crane, and a sublime passage about the grace with which birds move gives way to something much more visceral ... There's beauty to be found outdoors, but it's not without its horrors.The conflicted role of humans in nature is a familiar theme, but few narratives hum with the surreal power of this one." <b>&#x2014; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> </b><br><br>"This final work by one of Norway&#x2019;s most significant writers of the 20th century has the abstract, colorist strangeness of Matisse&#x2019;s late wall-hangings. What would happen if landscape entirely superseded people (as if this doesn&#x2019;t happen when we die). Here&#x2019;s a beautiful, arresting answer."&nbsp;<b>&#x2013;John Freeman,&nbsp;<i>Lithub</i></b><br><br>"This episodic novel was Norwegian writer Tarjei Vesaas&#x2019;s last book before his death, and the English translation by Elizabeth Rokkan relates a complex, overlapping set of vignettes that take place against the backdrop of the Norwegian countryside." <b>-Emma Specter, <i>Vogue</i></b><br><br>"Tarjei Vesaas is the best and most interesting Norwegian writer after the Second World War. His language is so sensitive, so open to his characters' minds and the landscape they inhabit, that it gives form to that space between - between people and other people, between people and nature - the space where our lives unfold." <b>-Karl Ove Knausgaard </b><br><br>"A clear crystal of imagination...a rare kind of masterpiece" <b>-<i>Daily Telegraph</i> </b><br><br>"A rare mixture of creative vitality, conviction and artistry." <b>-<i>Guardian</i> </b><br><br>"An excellent translation by Elizabeth Rokkan catches the quiet, poetic mood." <b>-<i>Sunday Telegraph</i> </b><br><br>"Infinitely calm and strong." <b>-<i>Daily Telegraph</i> </b><br><br>"Disturbing and beautiful...elaborate and powerful."<b> -<i>Sunday Times</i> </b><br><br>"A book of great strength and beauty." <b>-<i>The Times</i></b></p><h2>The British in India: A Social History of the Raj</h2><p><p><b>An immersive portrait of the lives of the British in India, from the seventeenth century to Independence</b></p><p>Who of the British went to India, and why?

When the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and screeches to a halt in front of him, it&#39;s the start of another far from ordinary year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter. Sirius Black, escaped mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, is on the run - and they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry&#39;s tea leaves ...But perhaps most terrifying of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds, with their soul-sucking kiss. These new editions of the classic and internationally bestselling, multi-award-winning series feature instantly pick-up-able new jackets by Jonny Duddle, with huge child appeal, to bring Harry Potter to the next generation of readers. It&#39;s time to PASS THE MAGIC ON ...</p><p>For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. <br>Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." <br>Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.</p><h2>Home and Away: Writing the Beautiful Game</h2><p><p><b>Two world-class writers reveal themselves to be the ultimate soccer fans in these collected letters</b></p><p>Karl Ove Knausgaard is sitting at home in Sk�ne with his wife, four small children, and dog.

This text examines the major areas in which the Japanese participate in religious events, the role of religion in the social system and the underlying views within the Japanese religious world. Through a series of case studies of religion in action - at crowded temples and festivals, in austere Zen meditation halls, at home and at work, at dramatic fire rituals - it illustrates the immense variety, energy and colour inherent in Japanese religion. It also discusses the continued relevance and responses of religion in a rapidly modernizing and changing society.</p><p><b>Ian Reader</b> is professor of religious studies at Lancaster University.<b> </b>He is the author of numerous books and articles on aspects of Japanese social and religious life.Add to your list of books on Japan this remarkable survey of religion.

Making the built environment useful, safe, comfortable, efficient, and as beautiful as possible is a universal quest. We dream about how we might live, work, and play. From these dreams come some 95 percent of all private and public buildings; professional architects design only about 5 percent of the built environment. While much of what non-architects build is beautiful and useful, the ugliness and inconveniences that blight many urban areas demonstrate that an understanding of good architectural design is vital for creating livable buildings and public spaces. To help promote this understanding among non-architects, as well as among those considering architecture as a profession, award-winning architect and professor Hal Box explains the process of making architecture from concept to completed building, using real-life examples to illustrate the principles involved in designing buildings that enhance the quality of life for those who live with them.</p> <p>To cause what we build to become architecture, we have three choices: hire an architect, become an architect, or learn to think like an architect. Box believes that everyone should be involved in making architecture and has organized this book as a series of letters to friends and students about the process of creating architecture. He describes what architecture should be and do; how to look at and appreciate good buildings; and how to understand the design process, work with an architect, or become an architect. He also provides an overview of architectural history, with lists of books to read and buildings to see. For those involved in building projects, Box offers practical guidance about what goes into constructing a building, from the first view of the site to the finished building. For students thinking of becoming architects, he describes an architect's typical training and career path. And for the wide public audience interested in architecture and the built environment, Box addresses how architecture relates to the city, where the art of architecture is headed, and why good architecture matters.</p></p><p>HAL BOX, FAIA, Professor Emeritus and former Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin, writes from fifty years&#x2019; experience in teaching and practicing architecture.

For fun, she started to translate, altering tones and vocabularies. From the Portuguese countryside and roaming sheep of 1914, a 21st century Toronto emerged, its neighborhoods still echoing the 1950s, their dips and hollows, hordes of wild cats, paved creeks. Her poem became a translation, the jubilant and irrepressible vigil of a fervent person. "Suddenly," says Mour� impishly, "I had found my master." Caeiro's sheep were his thoughts and his thoughts, he claimed, were all sensations. Mour�'s sheep are stray cats and from her place in Caeiro's poetry, she creates a woman alive in an urban world where the rural has not vanished, where the archaic suffuses us even when we do not beckon it, and yet the present tense floods us fully. In this ecstatic long poem of hope and creeks and cats and rain, Sheep's Vigil by a Fervent Person catches Governor General's Award-winner Erin Mour� at her most playful and ingenuous&#x2014;and wearing her Galician name.</p><p><b>Erin Mour�</b> is a poet and translator in French, Spanish, Galician, and Portuguese.

The poems recount his travels&#x2014;New York, North Carolina, Lowell (Massachusetts, Kerouac&#x2019;s birthplace), San Francisco, Denver, Kansas, Mexico&#x2014;observations, and meditations on art and life. The poems are often strung together so that over the course of several of them, a little story&#x2014;or travelogue&#x2014;appears, complete in itself.

He has received an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Somewhere between diary, verbal sketchbook and play-by-play account of whatever passed before his eyes, this collection of poems transcribed from notebooks Kerouac kept in his pocket between 1952 and 1954 turns out to rank with his most interesting work. From clipped descriptions of America's underbelly ("a pile of junk, &#x2014;&amp; the/ girders of the viaduct have / great black bolt heads/ like knobs of a / sweating steel black/ city") to vague hipster prophesying ("The next great con-/ flict will be between/ Hip &amp; Christ"), Whitmanesque embraces of his fellow man ("...I have cared/ for ye dutchmen"), love notes to famous beatnik friends ("O Allen Sad Allen Ah / Mystery") and sad, self-deprecating prayers ("Drink is good for/ love &#x2014; good for/ music &#x2014; let it/ be good for writing"), Kerouac hits all the notes for which he and his fellow beats are known. While not everything here is golden, the immediacy and unpretentiousness of this off-the-cuff writing makes it an intimate glimpse into the consciousness of a man who simply couldn't stop observing. A short, aggrandizing introduction by painter George Condo sets the tone. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The answer to this, according to Phillips, lies in a close examination of three internecine English-speaking civil wars&#x2014;the English Civil War, the American Revolution, and the American Civil War. These wars between cousins functioned as crucial anvils on which various religious, ethnic, and political alliances were hammered out between the English-speaking cousin-nations, setting them on a unique two-track path toward world leadership&#x2014;one aristocratic and aloof to dominate the imperial nineteenth century and the other more egalitarian and democratic to take over in the twentieth century. They also functioned as unfortunate and deadly cultural crucibles for African Americans, Native Americans, and the Irish.Phillips's analysis shows exactly how these conflicts are inextricably linked and how they seeded each other. He offers often surprising interpretations that cut across the political spectrum&#x2014;for instance, that the Constitution of the United States, while brilliant in many respects, was also a fatally flawed political compromise that contributed mightily in setting the stage for the final&#x2014;and the bloodiest&#x2014;cousins' war: the American Civil War.With the new millennium upon us and triggering widespread assessment of our nation's place in world history, <i>The Cousins' Wars</i> provides just the kind of magisterial sweep and revisionist spark to ignite widespread interest and debate. This grand religious, military, and political epic is the multi-dimensional story of the triumph of Anglo-America.</p><p>Political commentator Kevin Phillips (author of the 1991 bestseller <i>The Politics of Rich and Poor</i>) takes a break from analyzing the latest election returns with this sweeping history of Anglo-American exceptionalism. How did the political culture of Anglo-America rise "from a small Tudor kingdom to a global community and world hegemony"? asks Phillips. His answer comes in the course of studying three wars--the English Civil War, the American Revolution, and the U.S. Civil War. Phillips does not examine the military history of these conflicts, looking instead at the political, religious, economic, and sectional interests that shaped them. He makes several eye-opening observations, comparing, for instance, a "state-by-state portrait of which counties, towns, districts, or regions were loyal" during the American Revolution to "ethnoreligious maps of the modern-day Balkans." This is a hefty book (over 600 pages, not including appendices and footnotes), and while Phillips's preface is a bit self-absorbed, admirers of David Landes's <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i> and Jared Diamond's <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> will find much to like between its covers. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Praise for this title <p>"This is an elegant and provocative book...Phillips not only seeks out the religious foundations of political differences but finds an underlying Anglo-America that has not only endured despite these wars but has decisively reshaped the modern world. Not everyone will agree with everything Phillips says, but he does offer a bold synthesis that ought to stimulate public debate while it helps to enlighten us all." --John M. Murrin, Professor of History, Princeton University </p><p>"Kevin Phillips has written a remarkable book, tracing subterranean psychological and spiritual connections across decades of peace and war that most historians have ignored. His insights on the religious undercurrents of the American Revolution are particularly striking." --Tom Fleming, author of Liberty: The American Revolution </p><p>"If international politics on planet earth really is about 'the clash of cultures,' then Kevin Phillips has just told the story of the winner." --Byron E. Shafer, Andrew Mellon Professor of American Government, Oxford University </p><p>"The Cousins Wars is an exciting review of Anglo-America in the making." --Walter Dean Burnham, Frank C.

He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals.</p><p>From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the <i>Confessions</i> (in two volumes); <i>On the City of God</i> (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of <i>Letters</i> which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.</p></p><p><p>William McAllen Green (1897&#x2013;1979) was Professor of Latin at the University of California, Berkeley.</p></p><h2>Bob Dylan Anthology: Guitar Tab</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Split between loyalty to the Crown or to Parliament, war raged on English soil. The English Civil War would set family against family, friend against friend, and its casualties were immense--a greater proportion of the population died than in World War I.<br>At the head of the disintegrating kingdom was King Charles I. In this vivid portrait--informed by previously unseen manuscripts, including royal correspondence between the king and his queen--Leanda de Lisle depicts a man who was principled and brave, but fatally blinkered.<br>Charles never understood his own subjects or court intrigue. At the heart of the drama were the Janus-faced cousins who befriended and betrayed him--Henry Holland, his peacocking servant whose brother, the New England colonialist Robert Warwick, engineered the king's fall; and Lucy Carlisle, the magnetic 'last Boleyn girl' and faithless favorite of Charles's maligned and fearless queen.<br>The tragedy of Charles I was that he fell not as a consequence of vice or wickedness, but of his human flaws and misjudgments. <i>The White King</i> is a story for our times, of populist politicians and religious war, of manipulative media and the reshaping of nations. For Charles it ended on the scaffold, condemned as a traitor and murderer, yet lauded also as a martyr, his reign destined to sow the seeds of democracy in Britain and the New World.</p><p><b>Leanda de Lisle</b> is the highly acclaimed author of <i>The Sisters Who Would Be Queen</i>, <i>After Elizabeth</i>, and <i>Tudor</i>.

The polarized nature of the debate concerning Charles's execution, however, has advanced a simplistic understanding of the Stuart king's legacy, one concerned chiefly with his abuses of power and attachment to the doctrine of divine right of kings.

De Lisle's parliamentarians are an irascible group, resembling not so much freedom fighters as the tea party; on the other hand, the author's Charles often seems the voice of reason. Recent elections in Britain and the United States have produced surprisingly dysfunctional governments.

It covers many classic films and discusses their import, seeking to rescue the genre from the neglect of film theorists. The book should appeal to both film buff and fans of science fiction.</p><p><i>Screening Space</i>, the reprint classic from Rutger's University Press, has been significantly enlarged to update the science fiction film since the early 1980s, examining classic and contemporary sci-fi films as a significant genre. Winner of the 1995 Pilgrim Award, the book examines the differences between the religious themes of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and the clinical random evil depicted in <i>Event Horizon</i>. Vivian Sobchack's detailed analysis of a wide range of films and inclusion of black-and-white movie stills allows a better understanding of science fiction films as an art form that can often present its characters, a la <i>Blade Runner</i>, as "more human than human."Vivian Sobchack is professor of film studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.

To amuse himself, he explores the Neolithic sites there. But instead of ancient ruins, he finds evidence of a very recent murder.</p><p>Aaron Elkins is the author of the Edgar Award-winning Gideon Oliver mysteries.A conference on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall is the picturesque setting for Edgar-winning Elkins' latest forensic caper. His husband-wife team of Julie and Gideon Oliver (Julie, a supervising park ranger at Olympia National Park in Washington; Gideon, a forensic anthropologist) allows Elkins to do several things at once: get the couple invited to different venues; pack in enough local lore to function as a travel guide for readers; and provide two different perspectives on whatever bones Gideon stumbles across. This time, Julie has been invited to attend a biodiversity conference hosted by an eccentric Russian genius. Gideon pokes around the Neolithic sites and, not surprisingly, finds a contemporary tibia. While the local constabulary is denying that this can possibly be the result of foul play, a murder occurs at Star Castle, the site of the conference. Although the writing is precious at times, the forensic accuracy is admirable, and the plotting compelling. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Keller received her PhD in biophysical chemistry from the University of New Mexico in 1992. She was then awarded an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries.

Suspecting foul play, she seeks help from Dr. Nick Polchak, the &#34;bug man&#34; renowned for his ability to solve murders by analyzing the insects on victim&#39;s bodies. Nick and Riley uncover a sinister link between the lab&#39;s director and PharmaGen, a start-up drug company specializing in genetic research. They also discover that PharmaGen fronts an underground system to procure transplant organs for wealthy clients by finding and murdering matching donors. But PharmaGen learns of their security breach and orders the couple destroyed. While staying a step ahead of PharmaGen assassins, romantic attraction develops between Nick and Riley. But the attraction is complicated by a tragic secret that Riley hides -- a secret closely tied to one member of PharmaGen&#39;s operation which propels the novel to its astonishing conclusion.</p><p><b>Tim Downs</b> is a professional speaker and writer and has worked as a nationally syndicated cartoonist for fourteen years. His first book, <i>Finding Common Ground</i>, was awarded the Evangelical Christian Publishing Association's prestigious Gold Medallion Award. He has coauthored two other works of nonfiction with his wife, Joy. Tim and Joy are on the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ and live in Cary, North Carolina, with their three children.Romance among the maggots and blowflies? Well, yes, and plenty of hilarity and suspense in this delightful sophomore Bug Man novel from Downs (<i>Shoofly Pie</i>). After physically threatening a college student who falls asleep in his class, entomologist Nick Polchak is put on temporary probation. He meets up with Dr. Riley McKay from the Pennsylvania Allegheny County coroner's office, who is on the trail of something fishy and needs his help analyzing some corpses. A black market in transplant organs has resulted in targeted murders, and PharmaGen's traffic in applied genetic information may be a screen for other dubious dealings. Complicating things is Riley's own well-kept secret about her medical condition. The pacing drags a bit toward the middle, and a contrivance or two move the plot along, but Downs keeps the pages turning with some excellent twists and first-rate humor. He laudably knows how to show rather than tell&#x2014;a rarity for Christian fiction. Good entomological details add authenticity to the story, and the heavy themes of the pitfalls of a utilitarian approach to ethics and the hazards of judging human value on the basis of social worth are mostly thought provoking instead of preachy. Downs's flair for the unusual&#x2014;and his notable improvement over his already strong first effort&#x2014;make him a writer to watch in the faith fiction market. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After their monumental expedition, they told of raging rapids, constant danger, and breathtaking natural beauty of the American landscape at its most pristine.<br><br>Jon Waterman combines sheer adventure and environmental calamity in this trailblazing cautionary account of his 2008 trip down the overtaxed, drying Colorado. Dammed and tunneled, forced into countless canals, trapped in reservoirs and harnessed for electricity, what once was untamed and free is now humbled, parched, and so yoked to human purposes that in most years it trickles away 100 miles from its oceanic destination.<br><br>Waterman writes with informal immediacy in this eye-witness account of the many demands on the Colorado, from irrigating 3.5 million acres of farmland to watering the lawns of Los Angeles. He shows how our profligacy and inexorable climate change spark political conflict, and how we can avert this onrushing ecological crisis. As he follows Powell afloat and afoot, Waterman reaches out both to adventure travelers and to scientists, conservationists, environmentalists, and anyone interested in the fragile interplay between nature and humans.</p><p>Jonathan Waterman is the author of nine books, has made four television films, and works as a freelance author and filmmaker. In 2004, his writing about the Arctic won the prestigious National Endowment of the Arts Literary Fellowship.*Starred Review* Waterman, whose earlier books illuminate the Arctic, strikes an impressive balance between the personal and the political in chronicling his journey down the Colorado River. Quoting those who have traveled its depths before, such as John Wesley Powell and Wallace Stegner, he writes not only about the river&#x2019;s now-dying power but also the extensive regulations put in place to control and possess it. And yet as much as this is about the river, Waterman also discusses individuals invested in its survival from biologists to the many watermen and -women whose livelihoods come from navigating its length. The misguided playground of Lake Powell proves to be an unsavory stopping point, but the author perseveres in his search for answers. From Vegas to Mexico, he finds waste and ruin and then turns a corner to discover the fruits of hard-won battles for bird sanctuaries and brilliant uses of drip irrigation. Through it all, he ruminates about the choices between life and death for humankind and rivers. An evocative and bold take on a river and what winning the West really means, Waterman&#x2019;s book epitomizes the best of environmental writing. --Colleen Mondor</p><h2>House We Grew Up In</h2><p>House We Grew Up In</p><p>Lisa Jewell was born and raised in north London, where she lives with her husband and two daughters.

The Barbour and natty waistcoat in your profile photo make you look more like a Rupert or a Henry, something serious with two syllables, you know! And talking of syllables, and since you asked, no, I&#x2019;m not really called Rainbowbelle. OF COURSE NOT! I&#x2019;m called Lorelei and my name has three or four syllables, depending on how you say it. (My parents named us after mythical maidens. My sister is called Pandora. There was an Athena, but she was stillborn, so you know.) Anyway. Lor-a-lay-ee. Or Lor-a-lay. I&#x2019;m not fussy really.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m sixty-five years old and I live in one of the prettiest villages in the Cotswolds in a big, crazy old house full of what I call TREASURES and what my children call CRAP. We are probably ALL right. <br> <br>I have four children. Megan is forty, Bethan is thirty-eight and the twins, Rory and Rhys, are thirty-five. Oh, and thanks mainly to the frantic reproduction of my eldest daughter I am a multiple grandmother too! Do you have any children? You didn&#x2019;t mention them so I assume not? People usually tell you about their children before anything else, right? I don&#x2019;t see them very much, unfortunately, they&#x2019;re all so busy, and I&#x2019;m, well, I suppose you could say insular these days. I lost my partner about four years ago and things kind of unraveled from there, you might say.<br> <br>Anyway, what can I tell you about me? I love nature, I love the countryside, I love children, I love to swim. I&#x2019;m fit, for my age. I&#x2019;ve kept my figure over the years, and am grateful for that. I see some women I&#x2019;ve known for many years just turn to woolly mammoths once they pass menopause! And, as you can see from my picture, I&#x2019;ve kept my hair long. Nothing ages a woman faster than a haircut!!<br> <br>Anyway, that&#x2019;s enough about me. Tell me more about you! You say you&#x2019;re a widower. I&#x2019;m very sorry to hear that. And whereabouts in the North do you live? I can see from your photo that you have a dog. That is a very beautiful retriever. What is it called? We had a dog when the children were growing up, but once they&#x2019;d all gone, I could never quite see the point of animals.<br> <br>I will see what I can do about photographs. I&#x2019;m not really very techy beyond my laptop. But there must be something else I can send you. I&#x2019;ll check it out.<br> <br>Well, thank you, Jim, for getting in touch. The Internet really is a marvelous thing, especially for old codgers like us, wouldn&#x2019;t you say? I&#x2019;d be lost without it really. I&#x2019;d love to hear back from you again, but please don&#x2019;t feel you have to, if you think I sound dreadful!!<br> <br>Yours with best wishes,<br> <br>Lorelei Bird<br> <br>April 2011<br> <br>The damp heat came as a shock after the chill of the air-�conditioning that had cooled the car for the last two hours. Meg slammed the door behind her, pushed up the sleeves of her cotton top, pulled down her sunglasses and stared at the house.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br> <br>Molly joined her on the pavement, and gawped from behind lime-green Ray-Bans. &#x201c;Oh, my God.&#x201d;<br> <br>They stood together for a moment, side by side, the same height as each other now. Molly had caught up last summer, much to her delight. They now both stood at five foot eight. Molly long and lean as a fashion drawing, tanned legs in denim hot pants, honey-dusted hair bundled on top of her head in an artful pile, white Havaianas, a chambray shirt over a pink tank top, tiny ankles and wrists layered in friendship circlets and rubber bands. Meg, on the other hand, solid as a quarterback, sensible in three-quarter-length navy chinos and a Breton-�striped long-sleeved top, a pair of silver-sequined FitFlops and a last-minute pedicure her only concession to the unseasonal heat wave. Mother and only daughter, in the late stages of a nightmarish, clich�d teenage disaster that had lasted more than three years. Almost friends now. Almost. Someone had once told Meg that you get your daughter back when she&#x2019;s nineteen. Only four more years to wait.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is worse than I thought. I mean, so much worse.&#x201d; Meg shook her head and took a tentative step towards the house. There it stood, brick for brick, exactly as it had been the day she was born, forty years earlier. Three low windows facing out onto the street; four windows above; two front doors, one at either end; on the right by the side entrance a plaque, made by a long-dead local craftsman, an oval with the words The Bird House painted on it and a pair of lovebirds with their beaks entwined. The green-painted gate to the left of the house that opened up onto a graveled path to the back door, the stickers in the windows declaring membership of Neighborhood Watch (whatever happened to Neighborhood Watch? Meg wondered idly), allegiance to the RSPB and an intolerance towards people selling door-to-door.<br> <br>All there, just as it had been forever and ever.<br> <br>Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the worst house I&#x2019;ve ever seen,&#x201d; said Molly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s worse than the ones on the TV shows.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t even been inside yet, Moll, hold that thought.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And my nose too, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, probably.&#x201d; She sighed.<br> <br>The windows, which to her recollection had never been cleaned, were now so thick with grime that they were fully opaque. In fact, they were black. The pastel-yellow Gloucester brick was discolored and damaged. The green gate was hanging off its post by one solitary nail and the graveled pathway was piled high with random objects: two old pushchairs, a rusty bike, a dead Christmas tree in a broken pot, a box of magazines swollen and waterlogged to twice their original size.<br> <br>The flat-fronted style of the house meant that it held most of its personality within and behind, but even on such scant display, it was clear that this house had a disease. The village had grown more and more gentrified over the decades, all the old houses scrubbed to a gleaming yellow, doors and window frames Farrow-&amp;-Balled to the nth degree, and there, lodged between them, like a rotten tooth, sat the Bird House.<br> <br>&#x201c;God, it&#x2019;s so embarrassing,&#x201d; said Molly, pushing her Ray-Bans into her hair and wrinkling her tiny nose. &#x201c;What must everyone think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Meg raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say that judging by our local reputation this is probably no more than anyone in the village would expect. Come on then&#x201d;&#x2014;she smiled at her daughter, nervously&#x2014;&#x201c;let&#x2019;s go in, shall we? Get it over with?&#x201d;<br> <br>Molly smiled back grimly and nodded.<br> <br>April 1981<br> <br>Megan pulled back the ivy and pushed her fingertips inside a small crevice in the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got another one!&#x201d; she shouted out to Bethan and the twins.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, well done, Meggy!&#x201d; her mother called from the back step, where she stood in her strawberry-print apron watching proceedings with a contented smile. &#x201c;Bravo!&#x201d;<br> <br>Megan pulled out the small foil-wrapped egg and dropped it into her basket. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pink!&#x201d; she said pointedly to her younger sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; said Bethan. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got three pink ones already.&#x201d;<br> <br>Megan looked up at the sky; it was cloudless, densely blue, hot as July. Mum had said they needed to find their eggs quickly, otherwise they might melt. Her eyes scanned the gardens. She&#x2019;d found all the eggs in the woodpile, gingerly plucking them from next to rubbery woodlice. There&#x2019;d been more in the beds of daffodils and hyacinths that lined the pathways around the greenhouse and she&#x2019;d come across a big gold one sitting in the branches of the cherry tree outside the kitchen door. She counted up her eggs and found she had twelve. Bethan and the twins were still searching close to the house, but Megan suspected that the top garden had been all but stripped of its eggy assets, so she skipped down the slate-covered steps to the lower garden. Suddenly the sounds of her siblings and her mother faded to a murmur. It was warmer down here, soft and hazy. The grass had stripes in it, from where Dad had mown it yesterday, this way and that, and little piles of shaggy grass trimmings already turning pale in the burning sun. A camellia bush, confused by the early summer, had already bloomed and spilled its fat blossoms onto the lawn, where they lay browning and sated, halfway to ugly. Megan headed to the lichen-spotted sundial in the middle of the lawn. Three more foil-wrapped eggs sat on top of it and she brushed them into her basket with the side of her hand.<br> <br>She heard Bethan tripping down the steps behind her in her flamenco shoes. Megan turned and smiled. Sometimes when she looked at her little sister she felt overcome with love. Her worst enemy and her best friend.<br> <br>Meg and Beth looked identical. They both had what her mother called the &#x201c;Bird face.&#x201d; It was the same as her dad&#x2019;s and the same as her auntie Lorna&#x2019;s and the same as Granny Bird&#x2019;s. Apple cheeks, high foreheads, wide smiles. The only difference was that Megan&#x2019;s hair was brown and curly like Mum&#x2019;s, and Bethan&#x2019;s was straight and black like Dad&#x2019;s. Rory and Rhys, the twins, looked like their mum. They had &#x201c;Douglas faces.&#x201d; Low foreheads, long noses, neat bee-stung lips, and narrow blue eyes peering curiously from behind curtains of long blond hair.<br> <br>People always said, &#x201c;Oh, such lovely-looking children.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;You must be so proud, Mrs. Bird.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;What perfect angels.&#x201d;<br> <br>And Mum would say, &#x201c;You should see them when they&#x2019;re at home,&#x201d; and roll her eyes, with one hand running through �Rory&#x2019;s hair, the other wrapped around Rhys&#x2019;s hand and her voice full of love.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many have you got?&#x201d; Meg called out to her sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eleven. How about you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fifteen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their mother appeared at the bottom of the steps with the twins in tow. &#x201c;The boys have got nine each, I think we&#x2019;re almost there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Think yellow,&#x201d; she added with an exaggerated wink. The boys let go of her hands and ran towards the slide at the bottom of the garden that had yellow handles. Bethan ran towards an upturned bucket that was actually orange. But Megan knew exactly where her mother meant. The Saint-John&#x2019;s-wort bush right in front of them. She walked towards it and let her eyes roam over the clouds of yellow flowers abuzz with fat bumblebees before they came to rest on a row of terra-cotta pots underneath, overflowing with eggs and small yellow puffball chicks with glued-on eyes. She was about to scoop up the eggs and chicks when her mother touched her on her shoulder, her soft dry hands firm against Meg&#x2019;s sun-freckled skin. &#x201c;Share them,&#x201d; she whispered softly, &#x201c;with the little ones. Make it fair.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meg was about to complain but then she took a deep breath and nodded. &#x201c;Here!&#x201d; she called out to her siblings. &#x201c;Look! There&#x2019;s millions.&#x201d;<br> <br>All three hurtled to the Saint-John&#x2019;s-wort bush and their mother divided up the remaining eggs into four piles and handed them to each child in turn. &#x201c;Already starting to melt,&#x201d; she said, licking some chocolate from the edge of her thumb, &#x201c;better get them indoors.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cool of the house was shocking after the heat outside. It draped itself over Meg&#x2019;s bare skin like a cold flannel. Dad was pouring juice into beakers at the kitchen table. The dog was dozing on the window seat. The yellow walls of the kitchen were entirely covered over with the children&#x2019;s art. Megan ran her finger along the edges of a drawing that she&#x2019;d done when she was four. It always amazed her to think it had been stuck to the wall there, in the very same place, with the very same piece of Sellotape, for six whole years. She could barely remember being four. She certainly could not remember sitting and drawing this portrait entitled megn and mumy, composed of two string-legged people with crazy hair, split-in-half smiles and hands twice the size of their bodies, suspended in a gravity-free world of spiky blue trees and floating animals. The wall of art was a conversation piece for anyone coming into the house; it spanned all three walls, spread itself over cupboard doors, over door frames, around corners and even into the pantry. Dad would try and take some down occasionally, to &#x201c;update the wall&#x201d; as he&#x2019;d put it. But Mum would just smile her naughty-little-girl smile and say, &#x201c;Over my dead body.&#x201d; If Dad ever saw one of his children producing a piece of art he&#x2019;d snatch it away the moment it was shown to him and say, &#x201c;That is so very beautiful that I shall have to put it in my special folder,&#x201d; and spirit it away somewhere (occasionally tucked inside his clothes) before Mum saw it and stuck it to the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; she said, pulling her tangly hair back into a ponytail and removing her apron, &#x201c;you can eat all the eggs you like as long as you promise you&#x2019;ll still have room for lunch. And remember, keep the foils for the craft box!&#x201d;<br> <br>The &#x201c;craft box&#x201d; was another bugbear of Dad&#x2019;s. It had once been a small plastic toolbox neatly filled with sequins and pipe cleaners and sheets of gold leaf. Over the years it had expanded into an ever-growing family of giant plastic crates that lived in a big cupboard in the hall, filled with an impossible tangle of old string lengths, knots of wool, empty sweet wrappers, toilet-roll middles, old underwear cut into rags, packing chips and used wrapping paper. Megan didn&#x2019;t really do crafts anymore&#x2014;she was nearly eleven now&#x2014;and Bethan had never been as creative as her sister, while the boys of course would rather be roaming the gardens or charging about the house than sitting with a tube of Pritt and a handful of old ice-lolly sticks. No one really used the craft box anymore, but that didn&#x2019;t stop Lorelei constantly topping it up with all sorts of old junk.<br> <br>She pulled the egg foils eagerly from the children now as they discarded them, smoothing them flat with her fingertips into delicate slivers, her face shining with satisfaction. &#x201c;So pretty,&#x201d; she said, piling them together, &#x201c;like little slices of rainbow. And of course, they will always make me think of today. This perfect day with my lovely children when the sun shone and shone and all was right with the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked at each child in turn and smiled her smile. She ran a hand over Rhys&#x2019;s hair and stroked it from his eyes. &#x201c;My lovely children,&#x201d; she said again, her words encompassing all four of them, but her loving gaze fixed firmly upon her last-born child.<br> <br>Rhys had been the smallest of all of Lorelei&#x2019;s babies. Megan and Bethan had both weighed over nine pounds. Rory had been the first twin out, weighing in at a healthy six pounds and fifteen ounces. And then, as her mother often recounted, out popped poor Rhys like a plucked quail, a little under four pounds, blue and wrinkled and just about able to breathe on his own. They&#x2019;d put him under lights&#x2014;or &#x201c;lightly toasted him,&#x201d; as Lorelei also often recounted&#x2014;and declared him fit to go home only after three long days.<br> <br>Lorelei still worried about him more than the other three. At just six years old he was smaller than Rory, smaller than most of the children in his class, with a pale complexion and a tendency to catch colds and tummy bugs. He clung to his mother whenever they were out in public, wailed like a baby when he got hurt and, unlike his brother, didn&#x2019;t like playing with other children. He seemed happy only when he was here, at home, brother on one side, mother on the other. Megan didn&#x2019;t know what to make of him. Sometimes she wished he&#x2019;d never been born. Sometimes she really thought they&#x2019;d be better off without him. He didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;match.&#x201d; All the Birds were fun and gregarious, silly and bright.

She lives in Cambridge, England where she is now at work on the second Laetitia Talbot mystery, which Delta will publish in 2008.<i>Chapter One<br><br>Northern India, 1922<br></i><br>Putli's mother, her hands on her hips, straightened painfully, glad after two hours to break the rhythmic coordination of arm and shoulder, glad to stand back and count the mounting bundles of tall cut grass that had fallen to the steady swish of her sickle. The weight of the coming baby was beginning to unbalance her and slow her down. There was no doubt of that, but an early start while the oat grass was still wet had paid off and she was pleased. She called out a practised musical cry answered by her daughter working a few yards behind her on the steep slope that led up to the forest beyond the village. Glad to share this pause, mother and daughter smiled with wordless tenderness.<br><br>Her mother looked with satisfaction at the eight-year-old girl. Yesterday had been the most important day of her daughter's life. She had been feted and spoiled by the whole village and fed to bursting with puris and rich milk and sweetmeats. It had been her wedding day. Putli's mother had been proud to see the pretty girl, her eldest child, dressed for the first time in the costume of a married woman. No longer the infant in simple cotton dress, she was now wearing the tight blue bodice, the short skirt and the chaddar of the women of her tribe.<br><br>Putli's mother remembered the two small brown right hands clasping each other as the bride and groom made their marriage vows and she had been happy to see that the boy chosen from a neighbouring village was as strong and handsome as her daughter. The bridegroom's mother, a distant cousin, had earned her approval too, and this was very important for Putli's mother. In a few years Putli would leave her family home and go to join her young husband as his wife and become a part of his family. This was the way of it with girl children. Putli's mother acknowledged and accepted it but she would be sad. Oh, she had two good sons who had come after Putli and of these she was rightly proud, but it was her oldest child who was secretly her joy. She had a loving husband who had allowed her without question to rear Putli, although not all mothers of first-born girl children were so lucky. And her care had been rewarded by the constant good humour and energy of the child. She would miss her sleepy smile as she rose uncomplaining in the early morning to help with the meal and polish the cooking pots; she would miss her chatter as they brought back the cows or harvested the wheat. The light of her life would too soon be shining at another woman's hearth.<br><br>Putli opened her mouth to shout something to her mother but her mother never heard the words. In deep and stealthy silence a gold and black shape detached itself from the grass behind Putli and leapt at her. An iron-clad paw scythed through the air and severed the slender neck with one blow. The dark head, still entangled in its chaddar, fell to the ground and the tiger, seizing the body in its jaws, turned to make off through the long grass towards the trees above. With a despairing howl, Putli's mother swung about. Rage, disgust and hatred gave strength to her slim arm and she hurled her sickle in a glittering arc at the savage face. By the grace of the jungle spirits, the spinning blade hit the tiger in the eye and, half blind, his shattering roar changed to an almost human cry of pain and affront. Releasing his prey, the beast shook the sickle from his great head, turned and in a second was again a shadow amongst the grasses. The crumpled body of Putli lay at her mother's feet.<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br><br>Simla, May 1922<br></i><br><br>Ambling down the Mall, Joe Sandilands steered his sweating hireling through the thickening crowds to return it to the stables at the Chummery, enjoying, as always, the early morning sounds of the waking town. Simla, the summer capital of British India, rose early and went about its business at a brisk pace. Uniformed men were striding between the military establishments along the Mall, red-coated chaprassis, message boxes on hips, were speeding from Post Office to government buildings, their energy fuelling the flow of information spreading out from this unremarkable street and pulsing around the world. Joe shook his head half in admiration, half in disbelief. The eccentric little town perched in the Himalayan foothills half-way between the scorching plains of India and the frozen summits of the Tibetan mountains looked like nothing so much as a displaced Godalming. And yet, between March and November, the mighty British Empire was governed from here and that meant half the world, Joe supposed, conjuring up a memory of the pink-coloured lands he'd studied on his globe as a child.<br><br>Already the first nursemaids pushing baby carriages down the street were greeting each other, their fluting voices a treble accompaniment to the distant pounding of marching feet. As he wove through the purposeful crowds, Joe felt a stab of puritanical guilt to be at leisure when this small world was at work.<br><br>Not all of this small world though! He took comfort in the thought that his own temporary lack of occupation was as nothing to the endemic sloth he would find at the house he was about to visit. Eight o'clock. The four inhabitants of the Chummery would most certainly be still in bed sleeping off whatever had been the indulgence of the previous night, or, at best, tremulously astir. With any luck he would be able to sneak off back to the Residence without announcing himself. But then he remembered that there was in his pocket a telegram. He had been charged by Sir George Jardine, his host, the acting Governor of Bengal, to deliver this to Edgar Troop. Edgar, the leader of the louche coterie that inhabited the once grand house on Mount Pleasant, earned his position in the group by being the oldest, the most enterprising and the most unscrupulous. Unaccountably, he seemed to have Sir George's confidence. He did not have Joe's confidence, and though they had stood shoulder to shoulder in dangerous circumstances in the wilderness with that instinctive understanding and trust that two military men fighting towards the same objective experience, Joe found Captain Troop enigmatic, his style of living repellent. When he asked himself why he continued to spend more than a polite five minutes with the man, he had to admit that Edgar's cheerful cynicism and his appetite for life were ultimately seductive.<br><br>"You'll be returning your horse to the Chummery? Well now, when you get there I'd like you to deliver this to Edgar in person," Sir George had said. "Don't entrust it to anyone else in that hopeless establishment! Why? I don't often call at the Chummery but the last time I did so there were two telegrams on the mantelpiece. One was a year old and the other--goddammit!--was nearly two years old. Both unopened and one was from me! This could be important and I don't want it to go astray."<br><br>Joe didn't want to do this. He knew that if he was intercepted it would be nearly impossible to avoid a second breakfast leading to a drink or two, a morning of inconsequential gossip shading off into tiffin and imperceptibly into an afternoon moving lethargically round the snooker table. He wondered whether, if he rode round the back, he could hand his horse over, leave the telegram with a servant and make a discreet withdrawal, and this he resolved to try. To no avail. He had hardly turned into the compound before a window banged open and a cheerful voice summoned.<br><br>"Must have smelled the coffee, Sandilands!" Hospitably, the beaming face of Jackie Carlisle appeared at the window. "Come on board and tell us the latest news! You who have the ear of the great and good must have something interesting to tell us in this otherwise uneventful town."<br><br>Joe knew that he was caught and Jackie continued, "Heard someone say the other day, 'Where Sandilands goes, trouble follows.' Come on, Joe, live up to your reputation--enliven our dull lives."<br><br>Reluctantly, Joe handed his horse to a syce who had hurried forward on hearing the hooves on the gravel. In the Chummery, Joe had discovered, the grooms knew their business, but the house servants, of whom there seemed to be a number varying from day to day and from two to ten, seemed to take their pace from their employers. He let himself into the house and made for the breakfast room. Here at least there was order. The table was laid for four with piles of bread and fruit and a large steaming bowl of porridge. A large pot of coffee too--good coffee. That you could count on. Three of the inmates were already gathered around the table and dressed in their usual crumpled white linen suits. Jackie Carlisle entered clad in a silk dressing gown and made his way to the sideboard. Joe watched in awe as Jackie poured himself out a drink and threw it down in one gulp. His eyes bulged and his purple face took on a darker shade. He crowed, he stuttered as he fought for breath.<br><br>"Christ!" said Joe, impressed. "What was that, Jackie?" and he waited while Jackie spluttered on.<br><br>"Oh, for God's sake--someone loosen his stays," muttered Edgar.<br><br>"Only thing that gets me going these days," Jackie managed at last. "Want some?"<br><br>"I'd need to know what it was," said Joe guardedly.<br><br>Edgar intervened. "Don't touch the bloody stuff!" he said. "It's wormwood. Absinthe."<br><br>"Absinthe?" said Joe, surprised. "I thought it was illegal?"<br><br>"Yes," said Jackie, wiping his mouth and looking round vaguely, "I believe it is."<br><br>"So it should be," said Bertie Hearne-Robinson. "It'll kill him sooner or later."<br><br>Edgar picked up the glass and sniffed it. "This is nothing," he said. "When I was in the Russian army, most of my fellow officers imbibed it nasally."<br><br>"Edgar, is that linguistically possible?" Joe asked.<br><br>"Possibly not. But certainly <i>physically</i> possible! Witnessed it many times. They'd pour out a little cupful and snuff it up. Jackie may be in a bad way but he's not quite as bad as that. Not yet."<br><br>"It's boredom," said Johnny Bristow. "Poor old sod! Who can blame him? Nothing much happens. I know how he feels. When Joe's been up here a bit longer, goodness knows into what he'll be driven by boredom."<br><br>"Or into whom," leered Bertie. "Couldn't help noticing that Margery Phelps was showing more than common interest at the Gaiety last night . . . and Colonel Phelps is in Burma, I understand. Like me to fix it up for you, Joe?"<br><br>"Oh, come on!" said Johnny. "The Commander can do better than the garrison hack! Handsome young chap like him, chestful of medals, friends in high places, all the charm in the world, he can have his pick! Let's think . . . Now, little Maudie Smithson's still unbacked, I believe. She's quite a strider! What about it, Joe?"<br><br>The conversation diverted into an informed comparison of the attractions of the available ladies of Simla and much speculation as to the attractions of the unavailable.<br><br>"This is nothing but talk!" said Edgar. "Not one of you has anything going if the truth be told. Young chaps like you ought to be making things happen. When I was your age--"<br><br>Bertie hurried to cut him off. "When you were our age, you were Emperor of all the Russias! Don't tell us!"<br><br>This was beginning to turn into a mild Chummery quarrel and Joe didn't want to listen. Mercifully, he remembered his telegram. "Oh, by the way, Edgar--telegram for you. Or rather a telegram for Sir George for passage on to you. It's probably nothing but he said I had to put it into your hand. Hold out your hand!"<br><br>He passed a buff form across. Not much privacy here. All crowded round to read over Edgar's shoulder. As he watched he wondered very much how the leaky ship that was the Chummery stayed afloat. He knew that Jackie Carlisle was paid a substantial allowance by his wife's family to stay in India. He knew that Johnny Bristow carelessly but seemingly successfully bought and sold horses, had horses for hire and carriages for that matter. Bertie Hearne-Robinson was widely believed to have contacts over the border and not to be above a little gentlemanly smuggling in concert with a number of gentlemanly Pathans and all under the cover of the house lettings and sales agency he ran from an office in the Mall.<br><br>Then there was Edgar. What about Edgar? An accomplished shikari, he managed shooting trips for passing visitors. He arranged contacts and some of the contacts he was fabled to arrange were of a rather dubious nature. It was widely known that Edgar enjoyed shares in a prosperous and select brothel in the lower town. Perhaps it was no wonder that the respectable did not care to be seen to be associated with the Chummery, but at the same time perhaps it was clear why the adventurous sought their company, admired their style and, on annual return to Simla, found their way there. Want a game of polo? Johnny would fix it. Want to dispose of a few stones? Bertie was your man. Want to raise a small holiday loan? Jackie might be able to help. Easy terms, only needing a promissory note.<br><br>It was clear to Joe that demand would always create supply and when you had a town full of men--full of women too--on pleasure bent, the procurer, the middle man, would always prosper. That was what kept the Chummery going!<br><br>"Could we," he enquired mildly, "have a look at this fabled telegram? And could we--I beg your pardon, gentlemen--have a little privacy to do so?"<br><br>All were at once contrite. "Yes, old boy, of course. Good gracious! No problem at all!"<br><br>They rose in turn from the cluttered breakfast table and left Joe and Edgar alone.<br><br>Joe considered the once handsome square face opposite as Edgar studied the telegram. He seemed to be spending a disproportionate amount of time on such a short missive and had clearly read the text three times before Joe asked impatiently, "What's it all about, Edgar?"<br><br>"Ranipur," said Edgar. "They want me to go there. Happens sometimes."<br><br>The name was familiar to Joe. Ranipur. Familiar, but amongst so much unrelated information about India he couldn't place it.<br><br>"It's a princely state," said Edgar, and he lifted a framed map from the wall and set it on the table between them. "It's about three hundred miles away. Here's Simla. And down here there's Delhi. Now follow the railway line from Simla down to Kalka and Umballa. That's the way you came up last month. It's not shown but there's a branch line, a private line, connecting with the main one at Umballa. Here," he said, pointing with a splayed finger. "There's a narrow gauge railway like the one up to Simla. It was put in by the maharaja of Ranipur to improve access to his state.<br><br>"His state's big. Oh, not when compared with some of the states of Royal India like . . . Hyderabad, for instance, but big enough. About the size of Norfolk, I'd say. It's prosperous too. The maharaja is said to be the tenth richest man in the world. When you look at some of the competition that's quite a proud boast. He doesn't exactly get himself weighed in diamonds but he's not down to his last hundred million. In his youth he was quite a tough! He needed to be to keep his feet on the steps of the throne of Ranipur, slippery with the blood of half a dozen immediate predecessors. I never quite understood the ins and outs but I tell you--his early years in Ranipur would make <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> sound like one of Gilbert and Sullivan's jolliest!"</p><h2>Jerusalem&#39;s Hope (The Zion Legacy)</h2><p>In this bestselling series Bodie and Brock Thoene have thrilled readers with an epic tale chronicling the struggle for the world's holiest and most turbulent city. As <i>Jerusalem's Hope</i> opens, strategist Moshe Sachar remains hidden in a secret tunnel beneath the Temple Mount, safely removed from the chaos of Israel's 1948 war of independence, while the funeral of an elder rabbi proceeds above him. Using the instructions the rabbi gave him before his death, Moshe opens another sacred scroll and is once again transported to the dramatic biblical story of a charismatic but mysterious prophet. As word of the miracles performed by this seer spreads, bloody violence erupts, threatening the future of the Roman state and revealing the prophet's surprising identity.</p><p><b>Bodie</b> and <b>Brock Thoene</b>, with degrees in creative writing and history, respectively, are the authors of <b>Jerusalem Vigil</b> and <b>Thunder from Jerusalem</b>, the first two volumes of the <b>Zion Legacy</b> series.

The Thoenes live in Nevada and London, England.The Thoenes conclude their epic "Zion Legacy" series with another story-in-a-story, much like the previous The Jerusalem Scrolls and Stones of Jerusalem. Moshe Sachar is hidden beneath the Temple Mount during Israel's 1948 war of independence. When he opens another of the temple's ancient scrolls, the action shifts to first century CE. Word is spreading of the miracles performed by a mysterious prophet named Yeshua. The unlikely people Yeshua has touched--a Roman centurion, three orphan boys, and a rabbi from the high council--are all conflicted, wondering whether Yeshua is the Messiah. Only the head shepherd in Bethlehem is confident of Yeshua's true identity. As Passover approaches, an unruly mob in Jerusalem provokes Pontius Pilate to violence against them, and rumor spreads that Yeshua will spend the holiday there. Unfortunately, the novel never returns to the framing story set in 1948, so readers have no idea what happens to Moshe and his family. How satisfied readers will be with the inconclusive ending is debatable, but all libraries will want to complete the series. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Designs on the Heart: The Homemade Art of Grandma Moses</h2><p><p>It is a story that has gone down in the annals of American art history: a New Yorker visiting upstate Hoosick Falls is entranced by four pictures hanging in the window of a drugstore. Investigating further, he learns they are the handiwork of a 78-year-old widow. Thus begins the rise to fame of Grandma Moses--farmwife, painter, and unlikely celebrity. </p><p>In this book Karal Ann Marling, distinguished observer of American visual culture, looks at Grandma Moses as a cultural phenomenon of the postwar period and explores the meaning of her subject matter--and her astonishing fame. What did the "Greatest Generation" see in her simple renderings of people, young and old, tapping maple trees for syrup, making apple butter, gliding across snowy fields on sleighs? Why did Bob Hope, Irving Berlin, and Harry Truman all love her--and the art czars of New York openly despise her? Through the flood of Moses merchandise--splashed across Christmas cards, dishware, yard goods, and gewgaws of every kind--Marling traces the resonances that these "primitive" images struck in an America awkwardly adjusting to a new era of technology, suburbia, and Cold War tensions. </p><p>Between the cultural ephemera, folklore, song, and history embedded in Moses' paintings and the potent advertising shorthand for Americana that her images rapidly became, this book reveals the widespread longing for the memories, comforts, and small victories of a mythic, intimate American past tapped by the phenomenon--in art and commerce alike--of Grandma Moses.</p></p><p>Karal Ann Marling is Professor of Art History at the University of Minnesota.&#x201c;Karal Ann Marling has long provided astute and sympathetic commentary on diverse facets of American popular culture. <i>Designs on the Heart</i> continues in this vein: a great read full of interesting insights about an American artist that we all really 'know' but really don't know much about.

The result was the <i>Critique of Dialectical Reason</i>, an intellectual masterpiece of the twentieth century, now republished with a major original introduction by Fredric Jameson. In it, Sartre set out the basic categories for the renovated theory of history that he believed was necessary for post-war Marxism.<br><br>Sartre&#x2019;s formal aim was to establish the dialectical intelligibility of history itself, as what he called &#x2018;a totalisation without a totaliser&#x2019;. But, at the same time, his substantive concern was the structure of class struggle and the fate of mass movements of popular revolt, from the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century to the Russian and Chinese revolutions in the twentieth: their ascent, stabilisation, petrification and decline, in a world still overwhelmingly dominated by scarcity.</p><p><b>Jean-Paul Sartre</b> was a prolific philosopher, novelist, public intellectual, biographer, playwright and founder of the journal <i>Les Temps Modernes</i>. Born in Paris in 1905 and died in 1980, Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1964&#x2014;and turned it down.

Tabini-aiji, powerful ruler of the Western Association, along with Cajeiri, his son and heir, has returned to the Bujavid, his seat of power. But factions that remain loyal to the opposition are still present, and the danger these rebels pose is far from over.<br><br>Bren Cameron, the brilliant human diplomat allied with Tabini, has graciously chosen to visit Najida, his country estate on the west coast. He feels that the political tensions in the capital might ease if he is not present, and after two years in space, he relishes the peace and tranquility his lovely coastal home affords. <br><br>But peace and tranquility are not in the cards for Bren. <br><br>Desperate for freedom and adventure, disregarding the obvious danger, Cajieri, Tabini&#x2019;s young son, escapes the tightly guarded capital with his bodyguards and arrives to surprise Bren in the country.

In this time of heightened animosity and aggression, have humanistic values and democratic principles become irrelevant? Are they merely utopian fantasies? Or are they now more urgent and necessary than ever before?<br><br>Ever since the ascendancy of critical theory and multicultural studies in the 1960s and 1970s, traditional humanistic education has been under assault. Often condemned as the intolerant voice of the masculine establishment and regularly associated with Eurocentrism and even imperialism, the once-sacred literary canon is now more likely to be ridiculed than revered. While this seismic shift&#x2015;brought on by advances in technological communication, intellectual specialization, and cultural sensitivity&#x2015;has eroded the former primacy of the humanities, Edward Said argues that a more democratic form of humanism&#x2015;one that aims to incorporate, emancipate, and enlighten&#x2015;is still possible. A lifelong humanist, Said believed that self-knowledge is the highest form of human achievement and the true goal of humanistic education. But he also believed that self-knowledge is unattainable without an equal degree of self-criticism, or the awareness that comes from studying and experiencing other peoples, traditions, and ideas.<br><br>Proposing a return to philology and a more expansive literary canon as strategies for revitalizing the humanities, Said contends that words are not merely passive figures but vital agents in historical and political change. Intellectuals must reclaim an active role in public life, but at the same time, insularity and parochialism, as well as the academic trend toward needless jargon and obscurantism, must be combated. The "humanities crisis," according to Said, is based on the misperception that there is an inexorable conflict between established traditions and our increasingly complex and diversified world. Yet this position fails to recognize that the canonized thinkers of today were the revolutionaries of yesterday and that the nature of human progress is to question, upset, and reform. By considering the emerging social responsibilities of writers and intellectuals in an ever more interdependent world and exploring the enduring influence of Eric Auerbach's critical masterpiece, <i>Mimesis</i>, Said not only makes a persuasive case for humanistic education but provides his own captivating and deeply personal perspective on our shared intellectual heritage.</p><p>By considering the emerging social responsibilities of writers and intellectuals in an ever more interconnected world and pointing out that the canonized thinkers of today were yesterday&#39;s revolutionaries, Said makes a persuasive case for humanistic education and a more democratic form of intellectual criticism.Born in Jerusalem in 1935, Edward W. Said was one of the world's most celebrated, outspoken, and influential public intellectuals until his death on September 24, 2003. He is the author of more than twenty books that have been translated into thirty-six languages, including <i>Beginnings</i> (1975); <i>The Question of Palestine</i> (1979); the internationally acclaimed <i>Orientalism</i> (1979); <i>Covering Islam</i> (1980); <i>The World, the Text, and the Critic</i> (1983); <i>After the Last Sky</i> (1986); <i>Musical Elaborations</i> (1991); <i>Culture and Imperialism</i> (1993); <i>Out of Place: A Memoir</i> (1999); <i>Reflections on Exile and Other Essays</i> (2001); <i>Power, Politics, and Culture</i> (2001); and <i>Freud and the Non-European</i> (2003). He began teaching at Columbia University in 1963 and became University Professor of English and Comparative Literature there in 1992. He was a past president of the Modern Language Association and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Royal Society of Literature, and the American Philosophical Society.

Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. In 1959, Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Good Heart</i>, <i>The Meaning of Life</i>, <i>The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, and <i>The Compassionate Life</i>."This extraordinary and essential book of live oral teachings, transmitting the sublime View, Meditation, Action &amp; Result of the direct-access Dzogchen approach to incandescent awareess and the natural state of spiritual living, provides us with the basis for meaningful study and meditation practice for years and generations to come."

As a man of more seasoned years, one poised to enter his third decade of life, I knew far better than to let myself loose among such dangerous tools as dice and cards, engines of mischief good for nothing but giving a man false hope before dashing his dreams. However, I found it no difficult thing to make an exception on those rare occasions when it was another man&#x2019;s silver that filled my purse. And if that other man had engaged in machination that would guarantee that the dice should roll or the cards turn in my favor, so much the better. Those of overly scrupulous morals might suggest that to alter the odds in one&#x2019;s favor so illicitly is the lowest depth to which a soul can sink. Better a sneak thief, a murderer, even a traitor to his country, these men will argue, than a cheat at the gaming table. Perhaps it is so, but I was a cheat in the service of a generous patron, and that, to my mind, quieted the echoes of doubt. <br><br>I begin this tale in November of 1722, some eight months after the events of the general election of which I have previously written. The rancid waters of politics had washed over London, and indeed the nation, earlier that year, but once more the tide had receded, leaving us none the cleaner. In the spring, men had fought like gladiators in the service of this candidate or that party, but in the autumn matters sat as though nothing of moment had transpired, and the connivances of Parliament and Whitehall galloped along as had ever been their custom. The kingdom would not face another general election for seven years, and in retrospect people could not quite recollect what had engendered the fuss of the last.<br><br>I had suffered many injuries in the events of the political turmoil, but my reputation as a thieftaker had ultimately enjoyed some benefits. I received no little notoriety in the newspapers, and though much of what the Grub Street hacks had to say of me was utterly scurrilous, my name had emerged somehow augmented, and since that time I had suffered no shortage of knocks upon my door. There were certainly those who might now stay away, fearing that my exploits had an unpleasant habit of attracting attention, but many more gazed with favor upon the idea of hiring a man such as myself, one who had fought pitched battles as a pugilist, escaped from Newgate Prison, and shown his mettle in resisting the mightiest political powers in the kingdom. A fellow who can do such things, these men reasoned, can certainly find that scoundrel who owes thirty pounds; he can find the name of the villain who plots to run off with a high-spirited daughter; he can bring to justice the rascal who stole a watch. <br><br>Such was the beer and meat of my trade, but, too, there were those who made more uncommon uses of my talents, which was why I found myself that November night in Kingsley&#x2019;s Coffeehouse, once a place of little reputation but now something far more vivacious. Kingsley&#x2019;s had been for the past season a gaming house of considerable fashion among the bon ton, and perhaps it would continue to enjoy this position for another season or two. The wits of London could not embrace this amusement or that for too long before they grew weary, but for the nonce Mr. Kingsley had taken full advantage of the good fortune granted him. <br><br>While during daylight hours a man might still come in for a dish of coffee or chocolate and enjoy reading a newspaper or hearing one read to him, come sundown he would need a constitution of iron to attend to dry words. Here now were nearly as many whores as there were gamers, and fine-looking whores at that. Search not at Kingsley&#x2019;s for diseased or half-starved doxies from Covent Garden or St. Giles. Indeed, the paragraph writers reported that Mrs. Kingsley herself inspected the jades to ensure they met her exacting standards. On hand as well were musicians who played lively ditties while an unnaturally slender posturer contorted his death&#x2019;s head of a face and skeletal body into the most unlikely shapes and attitudes&#x2014;all while the crowd duly ignored him. Here were middling bottles of claret and port and Madeira to please discriminating men too distracted to discriminate. And here, most importantly, were the causes of the distraction: the gaming tables. <br><br>I could not have said what made Kingsley&#x2019;s tables rise from obscurity to glory. They looked much like any other, and yet the finest people of London directed their coachmen to this temple of fortune. After the play, after the opera, after the rout and the assembly, Kingsley&#x2019;s was the very place. Playing at faro were several well-situated gentlemen of the ministry, as well as a member of the House of Commons, more famous for his lavish parties than for his skills as a legislator. Losing at piquet was the son of the Duke of Norwich. Several sprightly beaux tried to teach the celebrated comedienne Nance Oldfield to master the rules of hazard&#x2014;and good luck to them, for it was a perplexing game. The great brought low and the low raised high&#x2014;it all amused and entertained me, but my disposition mattered little. The silver in my purse and the banknotes in my pocket were not mine to wager according to my owninclinations. They were marked for the shame of a particular gentleman, one who had previously humiliated the man on whose behalf I now entered a contest of guile and deceit. <br><br>I spent a quarter of an hour walking through Kingsley&#x2019;s, enjoying the light of countless chandeliers and the warmth of their fires, for winter had come hard and early that year, and outside all was ice and bitter cold. At last, grown warm and eager, with the music and laughter and the enticements of whores buzzing in my head, I began to formulate my plan. I sipped at thinned Madeira and sought out my man without seeming to seek out anyone. Such was an easy task, for I had dressed myself as a beau of the most foppish sort, and if the nearby revelers took notice of me they saw only a man who wished to be noticed, and what can be more invisible than that?<br><br>I wore an emerald and gold outer coat, embroidered almost beyond endurance, a waistcoat of the same color but opposing design, bright with brass buttons of some four inches in diameter. My breeches were of the finest velvet, my shoes more silver buckle than shiny leather, and the lace of my sleeves blossomed like frilly blunderbusses. That I might go unrecognized should anyone there know my face, I also wore a massive wig of the wiry sort that was fashionable that year among the more peacockish sort of man. <br><br>When the time and the circumstances seemed to me as I wished them, I approached the cacho table and came upon my man. He was a fellow my own age or thereabouts, dressed very expensively but without the frills and bright colors in which I&#x2019;d costumed myself. His suit was of a sedate and dark blue with red trim, embroidered tastefully with gold thread, and he looked quite well in it. In truth, he had a handsome face beneath his short bob wig. At his table, he contemplated with the seriousness of a scholar the three cards in his hand and said something in the general direction of the ample breasts belonging to the whore upon his lap. She laughed, which I suspected was in no small degree how she earned her master&#x2019;s favor. <br><br>This man was Robert Bailor. I had been hired by a Mr. Jerome Cobb, whom it seemed Bailor had humiliated in a game of chance, the outcome of which, my patron believed, owed more to chicanery than fortune. The tale I had been told unfolded accordingly: Subsequent to losing a great deal of money, my patron had discovered that Bailor possessed the reputation of a gamer who misliked the randomness of chance as much as he misliked duels. Mr. Cobb, acting upon his prerogative as a gentleman, challenged this Bailor, but Bailor had insolently excused himself, leaving the injured gentleman with no option but perfidy of his own.<br><br>Needing a man to act as his agent in these matters, he had sought me out and addressed his needs to me. I was, according to Mr. Cobb&#x2019;s instruction, to manufacture a battle of cards with Bailor. Mr. Cobb had employed me to that end, but I was not the only one in his pay. So, too, was a particular card dealer at Kingsley&#x2019;s, who was to make certain I lost when I wished to lose and, more importantly, won when I wished to win. Once I had succeeded in humiliating Mr. Bailor before as large a crowd as I could muster, I was to whisper to him, so that no other ears might hear, that he had felt the long reach of Mr. Cobb.<br><br>I approached the red velvet cacho table and stared for a moment&nbsp; at Bailor&#x2019;s whore and then for another moment at Bailor himself.&nbsp; Mr. Cobb had informed me of every known particularity of his enemy&#x2019;s character, among them that Bailor had no love for the gaze of strangers and loathed a fop above all things. A staring fop could not fail to attract his notice. <br><br>Bailor set down his three cards upon the table and the other two players did as well. After a smirk, he gathered the pile of money to himself. He slowly raised to me a pair of narrow eyes. The light was such that I could observe their dull gray color and that they were well lined with red, sure signs of a man who has been at play too long, has enjoyed his spirits overmuch, and is vastly in need of sleep. <br><br>Though somewhat hampered by bushy brows and a flattened nose with wide and flaring nostrils, he also possessed strong cheekbones and a square chin, and he was built like a man who enjoyed riding more than beef or beer. He therefore had something commanding about him. <br><br>&#x201c;Direct your eyes elsewhere, sir,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;or I shall teach you the manners your education has sadly omitted.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Och, you&#x2019;re a rude one, ain&#x2019;t you, laddie?&#x201d; I said, affecting the accent of a Scotsman, for in addition to fops, I had been made to understand that Bailor detested North Britons, and I was fully outfitted to attract his ire. &#x201c;I was only having a wee peek at the lassie you&#x2019;ve got &#x2019;pon you. Perhaps, as you&#x2019;re not using her for aught but a lap warmer, you might lend her to me for a spell.&#x201d; <br><br>His eyes narrowed. &#x201c;I hardly think you would know what to do with a woman, Sawny,&#x201d; he answered, using that name so insulting to Scotsmen. <br><br>For my part, I pretended to hold myself above such abuse. &#x201c;I ken I wouldn&#x2019;t let her turn stale while I sat playing at card games. I ken as much as that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You offend me, sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not only with your odious words but with your very being, which is an affront to this city and this country.&#x201d; &#x201c;I canna answer for that. Your offense is your own. Will you lend me the lassie or no?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;I shan&#x2019;t. What I shall do is challenge you to a duel.&#x201d; <br><br>This drew a gasp, and I saw that a crowd had gathered to watch us. Some twenty or thirty spectators&#x2014;sharply dressed beaux with cynical laughs and their painted ladies&#x2014;pulled in close now, whispering excitedly among themselves, fans flapping like a great mass of butterflies. <br><br>&#x201c;A duel, you say?&#x201d; I let out a laugh. I knew what he meant but pretended to ignorance. &#x201c;If your honor is so delicate a thing, then I&#x2019;ll help you see who is the man of the two of us. Have ye in mind blades or pistols, then? I promise ye, I am equally partial to both.&#x201d; <br><br>He answered with a derisive bark and a toss of the head, as though he could not believe there was still a backwards creature who dueled with instruments of violence. &#x201c;I have no time for such rude displays of barbarism. A duel of the cards, Sawny, if you are willing. Do you know cacho?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Aye, I ken it. &#x2019;Tis an amusement for lassies and ladies and little boys who haven&#x2019;t yet the hair on their chests, but if it is your amusement too I&#x2019;ll not shrink from your wee challenge.&#x201d; <br><br>The two gentlemen who had previously sat at his table now vacated, standing back that I might take one of the seats. I did so and, with the greatest degree of subtlety, glanced at the dealer of cards. He was a squat man with a red birthmark on his nose&#x2014;just the fellow my employer, Mr. Cobb, had described to me. We exchanged the most fleeting of glances. All progressed in accordance with the plan. <br><br>&#x201c;Another glass of this Madeira,&#x201d; I called out, to whatever servant might hear me. I removed from my coat an elaborately carved ivory snuffbox and with all deliberate slowness and delicacy took a pinch of the loathsome stuff. Then, to Mr. Bailor, I said, &#x201c;What have ye in mind then, laddie? Five pounds? Is ten too much for ye?&#x201d; <br><br>His friends laughed. He sneered. &#x201c;Ten pounds? You must be mad. Have you never been to Kingsley&#x2019;s before?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me first time in London, for all it matters. What of it? I can assure ye that my reputation is secure in my native land.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know not what back alley of Edinburgh from which you come&#x2014;&#x201d; <br><br>I interrupted him. &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis not right you address me so. Ken ye I&#x2019;m the Laird of Kyleakin?&#x201d; I boomed, having only a poor notion of where Kyleakin was or if it was a significant enough place to have a laird at all. I did know that half the North Britons in the metropolis claimed to be laird of something, and the title earned the claimant more derision than respect. <br><br>&#x201c;I have no concern for what bog you call home,&#x201d; Bailor said. &#x201c;Know you that at Kingsley&#x2019;s no one plays for less than fifty pounds. If you cannot wager such an amount, get out and cease corrupting the air I breathe.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Fie on your fifty pounds. &#x2019;Tis no more than a farthing to me.&#x201d; I produced a pocketbook, from which I retrieved two banknotes of ?twenty-?five pounds each. <br><br>Bailor inspected them to ascertain their legitimacy, for neither counterfeit notes nor the promise of a dissolute laird of Kyleakin would answer his purposes. These, however, came from a local goldsmith of some reputation, and my adversary was satisfied. He threw in two banknotes of his own, which I picked up and proceeded to study, though I had no reason to believe&#x2014;or to care&#x2014;if they were not good. I merely wished to antagonize him. Accordingly, I peered at them from all angles, held them up to the burning candles, moved my eyes in to study the print most minutely. <br><br>&#x201c;Put them down,&#x201d; he said, after a moment. &#x201c;If you haven&#x2019;t yet reached a conclusion, you never will unless you summon one of your highland seers. More to the point, my reputation is known here, yours is not. Now, we begin with a fifty-pound bet, but each additional wager must be no less than ten pounds.

Look for the same thoroughly researched and wonderfully accessible comics storytelling as O'Connor tackles the story of the Aphrodite from her dramatic birth (emerging from sea-foam) to her role in the Trojan War. </p><p>O'Connor has outdone himself with this volume: the story is riveting and the artwork is beyond compare. Greek mythology has never been so vivid! This title has Common Core connections.</p><p><b>A Neal Porter Book</b></p></p><p><b>George O'Connor</b>'s hit series, <i>Olympians</i>, has landed on the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list (<i>Hades</i> and <i>Poseidon)</i> and found a devoted fan-base among readers and educators. <i>Aphrodite: Goddess of Love </i>is the latest installment in the series.Gr 6&#x2013;10&#x2014;This sixth book in the series turns its attention to the goddess of love and beauty. Aphrodite is created from love itself, but once born, is quickly forced by Zeus into a loveless marriage to Hephaistos, the god of fire and smithing, in order to prevent conflict among the gods. Lonely and unhappy, she gives birth to Eros (aka Cupid), which sets about a comic chain of events that will change the course of human history forever. Although this volume is not as action-focused as earlier entries, O'Connor still weaves together an interesting and at times hilarious narrative about love and jealousy. His interest in the source material is evident on every page, as he brings these gods to life with his portrayals of complex emotions and distinct personalities while his simple, modern word choices make the text easily accessible. The illustrations perfectly match the text; each character gets a sleek, modern makeover while still remaining true to the clothing of the time period, and the use of soft, pastel colors set a lighthearted tone. Endnotes explain some of the more subtle references and allusions to previous works, while discussion questions, fact sheets, and an author's note further educate readers. This volume ends with a well-plotted and humorous retelling of the Judgment of Paris, where Aphrodite sets up the Trojan War wonderfully for future installments. Another strong addition to a great series.&#x2014;Peter Blenski, Greenfield Public Library, WI</p><h2>Introducing Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Psychological Skills for Understanding and Influencing People</h2><p>NLP skills are proving invaluable for personal development and professional excellence in counselling, education, and business.</p><p>A guide to one of the fastest growing developments in applied psychology; covers the classic NLP therapy techniques in depth, lists the books currently available on NLP, and gives advice on choosing an appropriate training course.Joseph O&#39;Connor is a trainer, consultant and author of nine books including THE ART OF SYSTEMS THINKING, INTRODUCING Nlp, PRINCIPLES OF NLP.

So it is in this spirit, with this new volume, that he severs the anthology from many of the formal and stylistic elements with which it made its name. Whereas past issues were oversize, colorful and filled with a variety of artists all designed to overwhelm the reader with raw power, <i>Kramers Ergot</i> 8 is a complete shift both aesthetically and physically. The size of the book is smaller, to encourage a more intimate reading of the material, and the content reflects a focus on substantial works from a small group of no more than a dozen artists who, rather than being aesthetically disparate, reflect a more specific and unified aesthetic space of discipline, sophistication and quiet power. Among the contributors are Anya Davidson, Leon Sadler, Ben Jones, CF, Sammy Harkham, Tim Hensley, Kevin Huizenga, Takeshi Murata, Robert Beatty, Chris Cilla, Gabrielle Bell, Frank Santoro &amp; Dash Shaw, Johnny Ryan and Gary Panter. It also includes a 40-page reprint of the 1970s comic strip "Wicked Wanda" by Frederic Mullally and Ron Embleton as well as an introductory essay by Ian Svenonius. Packaged in clothbound covers designed by artist Robert Beatty, this is the essential comics title of 2011.</p><p>The book is a beautiful object, a love note to good printing and care for materials, with soft cloth you want to rub against your cheek and a three-color foil stamp in black, neon orange, and gold. It&#x2019;s the kind of book printers send out as a sample to show what they can do. Its contents, on the other hand, and I believe the contrast is intentional, seem designed to make you so uncomfortable that the resulting feeling is about half an inch away from nausea.<br>This book has plenty of good reads, but it will also make you very uncomfortable. That impact, however, is a rare one from any artform, and it feels like something new and important. (Hilllary Brown <i>Paste Magazine</i>)<br><br>Every few years a comics compilation arrives for those of us who like our stories sans superheroes and a little cutting-edge.<br>I own three previous Kramers books, and all of them feature some of my favorite artists, along with several up-and-comers. This time around, editor Sammy Harkham chose creators that "reflect a more specific and unified aesthetic space of discipline, sophistication, and quiet power." (Whitney Matheson <i>USA Today</i>)<br><br>Eight installments in (and now on its third publisher), Kramers Ergot is sometimes discussed as if it&#x2019;s merely a report card on the state of alternative comics, as if the table of contents is all that requires our attention. Ergot 8 looks to shake that foundation a bit, opening as it does with the most bewilderingly aggressive tract Harkham&#x2019;s discovered thus far. From there, the book does take on a bit of a laundry-list quality &#x2015; there&#x2019;s Johnny Ryan, there&#x2019;s Ben Jones, there&#x2019;s Frank Santoro, Gabrielle Bell, all of your big dogs, they&#x2019;ve come for your bones &#x2015; but don&#x2019;t let the brevity trick you into thinking there&#x2019;s not something of substance going on. There&#x2019;s a method to the madness, and by the anthology&#x2019;s weird, atonal closer, you&#x2019;ll be laughing (or wryly grimacing, at the least) right along with it. (Tucker Stone <i>Flavorwire</i>)<br><br>In a reduction in size from the massively oversized previous issue, which is comprised of mostly single "broadsheet" comics pages by over 50 artists, KE 8 takes the form of a compact hardcover that focuses on short but mostly multipage visual progressions and graphic stories by eighteen contributors. These display a widely divergent range of visual styles, which are unified in their narrative content by irony and ambiguity. (James Romberger <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>)<br><br>Despite featuring a much smaller roster than previous volumes in the series, and despite a much less &#x201c;noisy&#x201d; visual aesthetic than that which has characterized the series since its phone book-sized fourth volume caused a sensation upon its release at the MoCCA Festival in 2003, Kramers Ergot 8 has an intensity that&#x2019;s tough to shake.<br>A cheekily provocative introductory essay from musician Ian Svenonius and a massive selection of racy reprinted Oh, Wicked Wanda! comics from the pages of Penthouse prove perplexing &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s a good perplexing, because it forces the reader to consider just how fingernails-on-a-chalkboard effective the rest of the volume is at discomfiting them.

Stephen J. Lennox, Ph.D., has that gift, delivering a powerful message in ,<i>God With Us: An Introduction to the Old Testament.</i> Troubled that the Old Testament is little known, little read, and little appreciated, he wanted to help those unskilled in reading the Bible or overwhelmed by its length to see its artistry, wisdom, and relevance. <i>God With Us</i> introduces the student to the Old Testament, examining the culture, history, and imagery of ancient times; and analyzing the structure, function, and message of the Old Testament books--with a focus on discovering God's plan and His character. This bird's-eye view of the Bible clearly demonstrates how God introduced a radically new and different ethical standard, one that took His people from where they were to where He wanted them to be.</p><p>Stephen J.

But the officer is the spitting image of G B Bretherton, a British officer missing in action....<br><br>So follows a tale of mystery and identity, first published in 1930, which is not only an authentic account of conditions at the Front, but also a remarkable thriller, with a highly unusual plot, which won Bretherton comparisons to John Buchan and the best of the espionage writers.<br><br>John Squire, the influential editor of the London Mercury said &#x2018;of the English war-books, undoubtedly the best is Bretherton.&#x2019; The Morning Post thought it &#x2018;one of the best of the English war novels.

His first novel, <b>Other Voices, Other Rooms</b>, was an international literary success when first published in 1948, and accorded the author a prominent place among the writers of America's postwar generation. He sustained this position subsequently with short-story collections (<b>A Tree of Night</b>, among others), novels and novellas (<b>The Grass Harp</b> and <b>Breakfast at Tiffany's</b>), some of the best travel writing of our time (<b>Local Color</b>), profiles and reportage that appeared originally in <b>The New Yorker</b> (<b>The Duke in His Domain</b> and <b>The Muses Are Heard</b>), a true-crime masterpiece (<b>In Cold Blood</b>), several short memiors about his childhood in the South (<b>A Christmas Memory, The Thanksgiving Visitor, and One Christmas</b>), two plays (<b>The Grass Harp</b> and <b>House of Flowers</b> and two films (<b>Beat the devil</b> and <b>The Innocents</b>).<br><br>Mr. Capote twice won the O.Henry Memorial Short Story Prize and was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He died in August 1984, shortly before his sixtieth birthday.Chapter 1<br><br> &#x201c;You are a mystery, my dear,&#x201d; her mother said, and Grady, gazing across the table through a centerpiece of roses and fern, smiled indulgently: yes, I am a mystery, and it pleased her to think so. But Apple, eight years older, married, far from mysterious, said: &#x201c;Grady is only foolish; I wish I were going with you. Imagine, Mama, this time next week you&#x2019;ll be having breakfast in Paris! George keeps promising that we&#x2019;ll go . . . I don&#x2019;t know, though.&#x201d; She paused and looked at her sister. &#x201c;Grady, why on earth do you want to stay in New York in the dead of summer?&#x201d; Grady wished they would leave her alone; still this harping, and here now was the very morning the boat sailed: what was there to say beyond what she&#x2019;d said? After that there was only the truth, and the truth she did not entirely intend to tell. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never spent a summer here,&#x201d; she said, escaping their eyes and looking out the window: the dazzle of traffic heightened the June morning quiet of Central Park, and the sun, full of first summer, that dries the green crust of spring, plunged through the trees fronting the Plaza, where they were breakfasting. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m perverse; have it your own way.&#x201d; She realized with a smile it was perhaps a mistake to have said that: her family did come rather near thinking her perverse; and once when she was fourteen she&#x2019;d had a terrible and quite acute insight: her mother, she saw, loved her without really liking her; she had thought at first that this was because her mother considered her plainer, more obstinate, less playful than Apple, but later, when it was apparent, and painfully so to Apple, that Grady was finer looking by far, then she gave up reasoning about her mother&#x2019;s viewpoint: the answer of course, and at last she saw this too, was simply that in an inactive sort of way, she&#x2019;d never, not even as a very small girl, much liked her mother. Yet there was little flamboyancy in either attitude; indeed, the house of their hostility was modestly furnished with affection, which Mrs. McNeil now expressed by closing her daughter&#x2019;s hand in her own and saying: &#x201c;We will worry about you, darling. We can&#x2019;t help that. I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s safe. Seventeen isn&#x2019;t very old, and you&#x2019;ve never been really alone before.&#x201d;<br><br> Mr. McNeil, who whenever he spoke sounded as though he was bidding in a poker game, but who seldom spoke in any event, partly because his wife did not like to be interrupted and partly because he was a very tired man, dunked out a cigar in his coffee cup, causing both Apple and Mrs. McNeil to wince, and said: &#x201c;When I was eighteen, why hell, I&#x2019;d been out in California three years.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But after all, Lamont . . . you&#x2019;re a man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference?&#x201d; he grunted. &#x201c;There has been no difference between men and women for some while. You say so yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> As though the conversation had taken an unpleasant turn, Mrs. McNeil cleared her throat. &#x201c;It remains, Lamont, that I am very uneasy in leaving&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Rising inside Grady was an ungovernable laughter, a joyous agitation which made the white summer stretching before her seem like an unrolling canvas on which she might draw those first rude pure strokes that are free. Then, too, and with a straight face, she was laughing because there was so little they suspected, nothing. The light quivering against the table silver seemed to at once encourage her excitement and to flash a warning signal: careful, dear. But elsewhere something said Grady, be proud, you are tall so fly your pennant high above and in the wind. What could have spoken, the rose? Roses speak, they are the hearts of wisdom, she&#x2019;d read so somewhere. She looked out the window again; the laughter was flowing up, it was flooding on her lips: what a sparkling sun-slapped day for Grady McNeil and roses that speak!<br><br> &#x201c;Why is that so funny, Grady?&#x201d; Apple did not have a pleasant voice; it suggested the subvocal prattlings of an ill-natured baby. &#x201c;Mother asks a simple question, and you laugh as though she were an idiot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Grady doesn&#x2019;t think me an idiot, surely not,&#x201d; said Mrs. McNeil, but a tone of weak conviction indicated doubt, and her eyes, webbed by the spidery hat-veil she now lowered over her face, were dimly confused with the sting she always felt when confronted by what she considered Grady&#x2019;s contempt. It was all very well that between them there should be only the thinnest contact: there was no real sympathy, she knew that; still, that Grady by her remoteness could suggest herself superior was unendurable: in such moments Mrs.<br><br> McNeil&#x2019;s hands twitched. Once, but this had been a great many years ago and when Grady was still a tomboy with chopped hair and scaly knees, she had not been able to control them, her hands, and on that occasion, which of course was during that period which is the most nervously trying of a woman&#x2019;s life, she had, provoked by Grady&#x2019;s inconsiderate aloofness, slapped her daughter fiercely. Whenever she&#x2019;d known afterwards similar impulses she steadied her hands on some solid surface, for, at the time of her previous unrestraint, Grady, whose green estimating eyes were like scraps of sea, had stared her down, had stared through her and turned a searchlight on the spoiled mirror of her vanities: because she was a limited woman, it was her first experience with a will-power harder than her own. &#x201c;Surely not,&#x201d; she said, twinkling with artificial humor.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; said Grady. &#x201c;Did you ask a question? I never seem to hear anymore.&#x201d; She intended the last not so much as an apology as a serious confession.<br><br> &#x201c;Really,&#x201d; twittered Apple, &#x201c;one would think you were in love.&#x201d;<br><br> There was a knocking at her heart, a sense of danger, the silver shook momentously, and a lemon-wheel, half-squeezed in Grady&#x2019;s finger, paused still: she glanced swiftly into her sister&#x2019;s eyes to see if anything were there that was more shrewd than stupid. Satisfied, she finished squeezing the lemon into her tea and heard her mother say: &#x201c;It is about the dress, dear. I think I may as well have it made in Paris: Dior or Fath, someone like that. It might even be less expensive in the long run. A soft leaf green would be heaven, especially with your coloring and hair&#x2014;though I must say I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t cut it so short: it seems unsuitable and not&#x2014;not quite feminine. A pity debutantes can&#x2019;t wear green. Now I think something in white watered silk&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Grady interrupted her with a frown. &#x201c;If this is the party dress, I don&#x2019;t want it. I don&#x2019;t want a party, and I don&#x2019;t intend to go to any, not those kind at any rate. I will not be made a fool.&#x201d;<br><br> Of all the things that fatigued her, this tried and annoyed Mrs. McNeil most: she trembled as if unnatural vibrations jarred the sane and stable precincts of the Plaza dining-room. Nor do I mean to be made a fool, she might have said, for, in contemplating the promotion of Grady&#x2019;s debut year, she&#x2019;d done already a great lot of work, maneuvering: there was even some idea of hiring a secretary. Furthermore, and in a self-righteous vein, she could have gone even so far as to say that the whole of her social life, every drab luncheon and tiresome tea (as in this light she would describe them), had been suffered only in order that her daughters receive a dazzling acceptance in the years of their dance. Lucy McNeil&#x2019;s own debut had been a famous and sentimental affair: her grandmother, a rightfully celebrated New Orleans beauty who had married South Carolina&#x2019;s Senator LaTrotta, presented Lucy and her two sisters en masse at a Camellia ball in Charleston in April of 1920; it was a presentation truly, for the three LaTrotta sisters were no more than schoolgirls whose social adventures had been heretofore conducted within the shackles of a church; so hungrily had Lucy whirled that night her feet for days had worn the bruises of this entrance into living, so hungrily had she kissed the Governor&#x2019;s son that her cheeks had flamed a month in remorseful shame, for her sisters&#x2014;spinsters then and spinsters still&#x2014;claimed kissing made babies: no, her grandmother said, hearing her teary confession, kissing does not make babies&#x2014;neither does it make ladies. Relieved, she continued through to a year of triumph; it was a triumph because she was pleasant to look at, not unbearable to listen to: vast advantages when you remember that this was the meager season when the junior assembly had only such deplorable persimmons to choose among as Hazel Veere Numland or the Lincoln girls. Then, too, during the winter holidays, her mother&#x2019;s family, they were the Fairmonts from New York, had given in her honor, and in this very hotel, the Plaza, a distinguished dance; even though she sat now so near the scene, and was trying to recall, there was little about it she could remember, except that it was all gold and white, that she&#x2019;d worn her mother&#x2019;s pearls, and, oh yes, she&#x2019;d met Lamont McNeil, an unremarkable event: she danced with him once and thought nothing of it. Her mother, however, was more impressed, for Lamont McNeil, while socially unknown, and though still in his late twenties, cast over Wall Street an ever enlarging shadow, and so was considered a catch, if not in the circle of angels, then by those of a but slightly lower stratum. He was asked to dinner. Lucy&#x2019;s father invited him to South Carolina for the duck-shoot. Manly, old grand Mrs. LaTrotta commented, and, as this was her criterion, she gave him the golden seal. Seven months later Lamont McNeil, pitching his poker voice to its tenderest tremor, spoke his piece, and Lucy, having received only two other proposals, one absurd and the second a jest, said oh Lamont I&#x2019;m the happiest girl in the world. She was nineteen when she had her first child: Apple, so named, amusingly enough, because during her pregnancy Lucy McNeil had eaten them by the barrel, but her grandmother, appearing at the christening, thought it a shocking bit of frivolity&#x2014;jazz and the twenties, she said, had gone to Lucy&#x2019;s head. But this choice of name was the last gay exclamation point to a protracted childhood, for a year later she lost her second baby; stillborn, it was a son, and she called him Grady in memory of her brother killed in the war. She brooded a long while, Lamont hired a yacht and they cruised the Mediterranean; at every bright pastel port, from St. Tropez to Taormina, she gave on board sad weeping ice-cream parties for gangs of embarrassed native boys the steward shanghaied from ashore. But on their return to America, this tearful mist abruptly lifted: she discovered the Red Cross, Harlem, the two-demand bid, she took a professional interest in Trinity Church, the Cosmopolitan, the Republican Party, there was nothing she would not sponsor, contribute to, connive for: some said she was admirable, others said brave, a few despised her. They made a spirited clique, however, these few, and over the years their combined strength had sabotaged a dozen of her ambitions. Lucy had waited; she had waited for Apple: the mother of a topflight debutante has at her hands a social version of atomic revenge; but then she was cheated out of it, for there was the new war, and the poor taste of a debut in wartime would have been excessive: they had instead given an ambulance to England. And now Grady was trying to cheat her, too. Her hands twitted on the table, flew to the lapel of her suit, plucked at a brooch of cinnamon diamonds: it was too much, Grady had tried always to cheat her, just simply by not having been born a boy. She&#x2019;d named her Grady anyway, and poor Mrs. LaTrotta, then in the last exasperated year of her life, had roused herself sufficiently to declare Lucy morbid. But Grady had never been Grady, not the child she wanted. And it was not that in this matter Grady wanted to be ideal: Apple, with her pretty playful ways and aided by Lucy&#x2019;s sense of style, would have been an assured success, but Grady, who, for one thing, seemed not popular with young people, was a gambling chance. If she refused to cooperate, failure was certain. &#x201c;There will be a debut, Grady McNeil,&#x201d; she said, stretching her gloves. &#x201c;You will wear white silk and carry a bouquet of green orchids: it will catch a little the color of your eyes and your red hair. And we will have that orchestra the Bells had for Harriet. I warn you now, Grady, if you behave rottenly about this I shall never speak to you again. Lamont, will you ask for the check, please?&#x201d;<br><br> Grady was silent some moments; she knew the others were not as calm as they seemed: they were waiting again for her to act up, which proved with what inaccuracy they observed her, how unaware they were of her recent nature. A month ago, two months ago, if she had felt her dignity so intruded upon, she would have rushed out and roared her car onto the port road with the pedal flat on the floor; she would have found Peter Bell and cut the mischief in some highway tavern; she would have made them worry. But what she felt now was a genuine disinvolvement. And to some extent a sympathy with Lucy&#x2019;s ambitions. It was so far off, a summer away; there was no reason to believe it would ever happen, a white silk dress, and the orchestra the Bells had had for Harriet. While Mr. McNeil paid the check, and as they crossed the dining-room, she held Lucy&#x2019;s arm and with a coltish awkwardness gave her cheek a delicate spontaneous peck. It was a gesture that had the sudden effect of unifying them all; they were a family: Lucy glowed, her husband, her daughters, she was a proud woman, and Grady, for all her stubborn oddness was, let anyone say whatever they would, a wonderful child, a real person. &#x201c;Darling,&#x201d; Lucy said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to miss you.&#x201d;<br><br> Apple, who was walking ahead, turned around. &#x201c;Did you drive your car in this morning, Grady?&#x201d;<br><br> Grady was slow in answering; lately everything Apple said seemed suspicious; why care, really? What if Apple did know? Still, she did not want her to. &#x201c;I took the train from Greenwich.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then you left the car at home?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why, does it make any difference?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No; well, yes. And you needn&#x2019;t bark at me. I only thought you could drive me out on the Island. I promised George I&#x2019;d stop by the apartment and pick up his encyclopedia&#x2014;such a heavy thing. I&#x2019;d hate to carry it on the train. If we got there early enough you could go swimming.&#x201d;</p><h2>Berber &amp; Q</h2><p><b><i>Ditch burnt, joyless burgers for bold, flavoursome and wonderfully surprising barbecue food</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b></b>&#x2018;Packed with over 120 tasty and tantalising barbecue recipes&#x2019; &#x2013; <i>Great British Food</i><br><br>Here are over <b>120 of the very best, lip-smackingly good barbecue recipes</b> from ex-Ottolenghi chef, Josh Katz.

A world-renowned scientist and freshwater expert, Gleick is a MacArthur Foundation "genius," and according to the BBC, an environmental visionary. And he drinks from the tap. Why don&#x2019;t the rest of us?<br> &nbsp;<br> Bottled and Sold shows how water went from being a free natural resource to one of the most successful commercial products of the last one hundred years&#x2014;and why we are poorer for it. It&#x2019;s a big story and water is big business. Every second of every day in the United States, a thousand people buy a plastic bottle of water, and every second of every day a thousand more throw one of those bottles away. That adds up to more than thirty billion bottles a year and tens of billions of dollars of sales.<br> &nbsp;<br> Are there legitimate reasons to buy all those bottles? With a scientist&#x2019;s eye and a natural storyteller&#x2019;s wit, Gleick investigates whether industry claims about the relative safety, convenience, and taste of bottled versus tap hold water. And he exposes the true reasons we&#x2019;ve turned to the bottle, from fearmongering by business interests and our own vanity to the breakdown of public systems and global inequities.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Designer" H2O may be laughable, but the debate over commodifying water is deadly serious. It comes down to society&#x2019;s choices about human rights, the role of government and free markets, the importance of being "green," and fundamental values. Gleick gets to the heart of the bottled water craze, exploring what it means for us to bottle and sell our most basic necessity.</p><p>Peter H. Gleick is President of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security in Oakland, California, and is a recipient of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship for his work on water issues.<br><br>"Gleick covers the topic in illuminating detail, yet packages his writing with the skill and passion of a novelist. Supported by research, including interviews and plant visits, Gleick examines how water is found, pumped, bottled, treated, lied about, and sold to a relatively unsuspecting public. If selling bottled water is a shell game, Gleick picks the right shell every time....<i>Bottled and Sold</i> is a necessary book: we are surely in for serious water damage in the future if we continue to drink our water from bottles. Every citizen should read it; every legislator and state natural resource administrator should have a desk copy. Lobbyists who prowl the halls of Congress seeking to overturn long-standing common water laws ought to be made to read this, twice. It seems impossible that a reader would come away from Gleick's book with a desire to ever buy another plastic bottle of water. It's that compelling." (<i>Foreword Magazine</i>)<br><br>"Gleick trains his scientifically objective eye on the bottled water phenomenon... [and] offers a sobering yet sensible look at society's ill-considered thirst for bottled water." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"With the gusto of a born raconteur and the passion of a believer, Gleick makes a sound case for improving the developing world's access to and the developed world's attitude toward safe, piped drinking water purified by the natural hydrologic cycle." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"In his insightful new book, <i>Bottled &amp; Sold</i>, the scientist and freshwater expert chronicles how modern society has abandoned one of its greatest public health achievements in favor of a financially and environmentally costly alternative... The book's power lies in his obvious yet compelling argument: Rather than shore up the natural processes that have provided us with drinkable water for centuries, we have invented an elaborate business that causes more harm than good." (<i>The Washington Post</i>)<br><br>"Alongside fascinating discursions into the history of the public water fountain, cholera, and Kabbalah, Gleick provides an dispassionate glimpse into purposeful distortions of science that drive us to believe bottled water will make us 'healthier, skinnier, or more popular.'" (<i>SEED Magazine</i>)<br><br>"Peter Gleick, one of the most visible and respected advocates for smart water use, has made a well-researched and timely first foray into popular nonfiction with his new book, <i>Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water</i>. ...Gleick culls first-rate anecdotes&#x2014;some personal, some historical&#x2014;to illuminate the more perplexing and revealing twists behind the bottled-water industry's rapid growth." (<i>NatGeo NewsWatch</i>)<br><br>"Extremely enlightening...Gleick offers a broad indictment of the bottled water industry." (<i>Business World</i>)<br><br>"This is my favorite kind of book: packed with facts but such a pleasure to read. Peter Gleick has skillfully navigated the complex landscape of bottled water, covering everything from neglected municipal systems to bogus advertisers to piles of plastic waste. Congratulations to Gleick for tackling a problem of gigantic proportions and especially for charting a viable positive way forward." (Annie Leonard, author of "The Story of Stuff")<br><br>"We ended the sale of bottled water in 2007 at Chez Panisse as its environmental implications became clear. After reading Peter H. Gleick's startling investigation of the lucrative and unsustainable bottled water industry, I am confident we made the right decision. Water is our most primary element. It is precious and its access should be a democratic right. <i>Bottled and Sold</i> is a carefully researched, clear-eyed look at an industry that too often escapes the public glare." (Alice Waters, chef, author, and proprietor of Chez Panisse)<br><br>"The P.R. execs and charlatans who hawk bottled water don't want us asking a fundamental question: Will we abandon our commitment to providing safe public tap water? Peter Gleick takes the issue head on. He brilliantly captures the environmental, economic, and moral dimensions of the bottled water controversy in an exploration that is authoritative yet entertaining, alarming yet optimistic."

She has weaved a delightful yarn with a cast of affable characters and somehow manages to make a rusted 1949 DeSoto in a Louisiana swamp a cozy home for two raccoon scouts--absolutely charming.&#x201d; Author: Harry Bliss, New Yorker illustrator and illustrator of Diary of a Worm<br><br>* "Told from the perspectives of animals and humans, Appelt&#x2019;s (The Underneath) rollicking tall tale exposes the trouble brewing in Sugar Man swamp. The main concern of Bingo and J&#x2019;miah, two raccoon Swamp Scouts, is the approaching brood of feral hogs, which could destroy the precious canebrake sugar used to make fried pies at the local Paradise Pies cafe. Meanwhile, 12-year-old Chap Brayburn, the cafe proprietor&#x2019;s son, is worried about rich, horrible Sonny Boy Beaucoup, who wants to turn the swamp into the &#x201c;Gator World Wrestling Arena and Theme Park.&#x201d; The swamp&#x2019;s salvation may lie with the furry, bearlike Sugar Man, whose &#x201c;hands were as large as palmetto ferns&#x201d; and &#x201c;feet were like small boats,&#x201d; but finding and awakening him is no easy task. The book&#x2019;s folksy narrative adds brightness and humor to the story as Appelt explores the swamp&#x2019;s rich history, varied denizens, and current threats. Heroes and villains are drawn in bold strokes, but while there&#x2019;s little doubt who will emerge victorious, finding out how events unfurl is well worth the read." Source: Publishers Weekly, STARRED REVIEW<br><br>&#x201c;Kathi Appelt&#x2019;s prose rolls like swamp mist and molasses. A sweet and tangy American classic.&#x201d; Author: Peter H. Reynolds, creator of The Dot and illustrator of Someday<br><br><b>* </b>&#x201c;Appelt returns with a rich tale set deep in a Texas swamp, full of critters including gators, rattlesnakes, and feral hogs. Brothers Bingo and J&#x2019;miah are true-blue scouts (raccoons) who have set up house in an abandoned old DeSoto, adorning it with their artwork and following orders from the Voice of Intelligence (actually the lightning-enabled car radio). The young raccoons are affable and easy to root for as they attempt to stop the gang of wild hogs intent on destroying their beloved Muscovado sugar cane.... Appelt has adeptly intertwined the folksy narrative of a tall tale with a perfect blend of adventure and mystery, all the while subtly bringing an ecological message to the surface.&#x201d; Source: School Library Journal, July 2013, STARRED REVIEW<br><br>&#x201c;Kathi Appelt can tell a story. She has published over 30 children&#x2019;s books, for everyone from toddlers to teenagers, and won awards, including a Newberry Honor, along the way. In &#x201c;The True Blue Scouts of Sugar Man Swamp,&#x201d; aimed at middle-grade readers, Appelt returns to the folksy narrative voice of her beloved picture book, &#x201c;Bubba and Beau, Best Friends.&#x201d; Her mastery of pacing and tone makes for wonderful reading aloud, even to children who would happily take on a relatively long novel on their own. There is music in her prose: &#x2018;For as long as raccoons had inhabited the Sugar Man Swamp, which was eons, they had been the Official Scouts, ordained by the Sugar Man himself back in the year Aught One, also known as the beginning of time.&#x2019;...In short chapters, in a style reminiscent of &#x201c;Holes&#x201d; by Louis Sachar, Appelt tells a mythic tale with a rich cast of characters. And as in Carl Hiaasen&#x2019;s &#x201c;Hoot,&#x201d; the threat of an impending environmental disaster moves the plot along...Appelt takes her readers to spy on a greedy land developer, Sonny Boy Beaucoup, who is plotting with Jaeger Stitch, the World Champion Gator Wrestler of the Northern Hemisphere (her signature move: kissing the defeated reptile on the lips) to implement a nefarious plan to create an adventure theme park on the land, destroying the swamp habitat. And if that isn&#x2019;t enough excitement, a rampaging gang of huge wild hogs is headed in the direction of Sugar Man Swamp, wrecking everything in its path. &#x2018;Mothers and fathers, lock your doors. Pull the covers up to your chinny chin chins. Head for the hills.&#x2019; All that&#x2019;s missing is a soundtrack by T Bone Burnett. Appelt gracefully balances seemingly unrelated plotlines: the story of fearless Bingo and cautious J&#x2019;Miah as they set forth on their quest for the Sugar Man, Chap&#x2019;s determination to save his mother&#x2019;s Paradise Pies Caf� and their home by earning a &#x2018;boatload&#x2019; of cash, and Grandpa Audie&#x2019;s swamp adventures...Even as the plot heats up, Appelt keeps the humor coming, as when Chap&#x2019;s large ginger cat, Sweetums, tries to warn the household of impending disaster. Sadly, none of the humans understand his language, Catalin, and Sweetums runs off in a snit, dodges underneath the bed and starts grooming himself. Appelt ties up all these threads neatly in a triumphant and unexpected confrontation of good and evil. Will Bingo and J&#x2019;Miah face their fears? Will Chap save his mother&#x2019;s livelihood and their home? And where is the Sugar Man, anyway?

What follows is a deadly struggle that sees him scampering from the hallowed wicket of Lord&#39;s to the jungle lairs of Borneo pirates, from a Newgate hanging to the torture pits of Madagascar, and from Chinatown&#39;s vice dens to slavery in the palace of &#39;the female Caligula&#39; herself, Queen Ranavalona of Madagascar. Had he known what lay ahead, Flashman would never have taken up cricket seriously.</p><p>George MacDonald Fraser OBE was a bestselling historical novelist, journalist and screenwriter.

These buildings reveal the qualities in Richardson&#x2019;s work that made him both a prophet of culture and a remnant of the past &#x2014; his assimilation of the Romanesque style, the functional disposition of the parts in his buildings and expressive use of materials, and especially the use of the windows as an integral part of the interior development rather than of the fa�ade alone.<br>The author begins with Richardson&#x2019;s biography &#x2014; his family background, his childhood in Louisiana, his studies at Harvard and at L&#x2019;�cole des Beaux Arts in Paris, his professional establishment, first in New York and then in Brookline, Massachusetts, and his public and personal life. This section includes many extensive quotations from Richardson&#x2019;s letters and from the writings of friends.<br>The remaining two thirds of the book are taken up with examinations of Richardson&#x2019;s work. There are chapters on his early work (with detailed attention to his first commission, the Church of the Unity in Springfield, Massachusetts); his first great work, Trinity Church in Boston; works of middle life, such as the Cheney Building in Hartford and Harvard&#x2019;s Sever Hall; the New York State Capitol in Albany; Albany City Hall, the Harvard Law School, and other works of his later years; the Pittsburgh Courthouse and his plans for the proposed Albany Cathedral; the Field Building in Chicago and the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce; railroad stations and dwelling houses in Washington, St. Louis, Chicago, Buffalo, and many smaller cities. After appreciative chapters on Richardson&#x2019;s characteristics as an artist and his methods of teaching, the book concludes with an appraisal of his influence on the architectural profession and on the public.</p><p>Mariana Griswold Van Rensselaer (1851&#x2013;1934) was the first female architecture critic of note.

French knots, tufting, stem stitch, whipped spider&#39;s web, woven picot and more are included and combined with painted backgrounds, couching, padded work and twisted threads to create a sequence of easy-to-follow projects. Pat Trott guides the embroiderer through each stage, showing how to build up scenes and pictures. Using nature as her source of design, she demonstrates the techniques involved in creating flowers, plants, woodlands and seashores.</p><p>Pat Trott was introduced to Armenian needlelace by her mother at a very early age, and this led to her passion for embroidery and stitchery of all kinds. Later, as a skilled embroiderer, she was attracted to Mountmellick because of the numerous different stitches involved, and she went on to become an expert in this unique craft. Pat is a life member of the Embroiderers&#39; Guild and holds regular workshops for many Guild branches, colleges and schools. Pat has had her work featured in Needlework Magazine and New Stitches Magazine.Winter 05 The illustrations in this book are very interesting with different types, colours and thicknesses of threads used. The instructions for the stitches are well depicted and should be of interest to those of us who wish to experiement with stitches that are not available in many other stitch guides. An inexpensive book to add to one&#39;s collection. * West Country Embroiderers * Sept 08 The first half of this book includes a very practical stitch guide with clear step-by-step photos for each stitch, as well as tips on fabric painting techniques (etc). The second half of the book is project-based, with full-colour pictures, line drawings to trace, and full instructions. If you want to learn how to add texture to your embroidery, this book is a great starting point. It&#39;s a shame the cover is not shown here, as it really does give a good idea of what to expect from the contents. My main thoughts on this book are really only minor quibbles. I thought that although the stitch reference guide was very practical, it perhaps showed fewer stitches in greater detail than strictly necessary, at the expense of instead including a wider variety of stitches to choose from. Also, although the projects in the latter half are attractive, they didn&#39;t really excite me greatly (obviously, this is purely a matter of personal taste). Having said that, there are various elements of the projects that did appeal to me, and I can imagine adapting them within my own work. I also thought the instructions were very comprehensive and well-written, so perfect for anyone who DID want to follow the projects exactly as presented. The stitches and projects in this book are intended for free embroidery, but I think actually most aspects could be successfully adapted for counted thread embroidery, so creative counted embroiderers should not dismiss this book as irrelevant. At first glance, I didn&#39;t think this book quite lived up to my hopes for it, but after consideration, the way it is presented does actually offer a lot of versatility, and I think I will be able to use the contents in a very practical way, especially as departure points for linked ideas. Although I would have preferred greater quantity in terms of stitch reference, this is still a lovely book to add to my collection, and sits well alongside Gilda Baron&#39;s `The Art of Embroidered Flowers&#39;. Su Mwumba * Waterstones Newsletter * Issue 36, Jun/Jul 05 Pat Trott shows you how to bring your embroidery to life in this step-by-step guide. it is illustrated throughout with diagrams and step-by-step photography that take you through 17 different stitches as well as exploring ways of combining stitches and colours. Pat&#39;s easy to follow projects include a rockery, climbing roses, a beach scene and daffodils in a wood. This little book is useful for both embroiders who want to add a new dimension to their work and to quilters who want to explore new ways of embellishing, and is worthy of any bookshelf. * Fabrications * Issue 90, Jul 05 Pat Trott shows us how to bring embroideries to life with her original and vibrant guide. We learn how to create many different raised stitches. French knots, tufting, stem stitch, whipped spider&#39;s web, woven picot and more are included so the book would be wonderful for anyone who likes to add Swiss darning to knitting.

When the Irish emigrated to North America, some of the Gentry followed...only to find that the New World already had spirits of its own, called <i>manitou</i> and other such names by the Native tribes.</p><p>Now generations have passed, and the Irish have made homes in the new land, but the Gentry still wander homeless on the city streets. Gathering in the city shadows, they bide their time and dream of power. As their dreams grow harder, darker, fiercer, so do the Gentry themselves--appearing, to those with the sight to see them, as hard and dangerous men, invariably dressed in black.</p><p>Bettina can see the Gentry, and knows them for what they are. Part Indian, part Mexican, she was raised by her grandmother to understand the spirit world. Now she lives in Kellygnow, a massive old house run as an arts colony on the outskirts of Newford, a world away from the Southwestern desert of her youth. Outsider her nighttime window, she often spies the dark men, squatting in the snow, smoking, brooding, waiting. She calls them <i>los lobos</i>, the wolves, and stays clear of them--until the night one follows her to the woods, and takes her hand....</p><p>Ellie, an independent young sculptor, is another with magic in her blood, but she refuses to believe it, even though she, too, sees the dark men. A strange old woman has summoned Ellie to Kellygnow to create a mask for her based on an ancient Celtic artifact. It is the mask of the mythic Summer King--another thing Ellie does not believe in. Yet lack of belief won't dim the power of the mast, or its dreadful intent.</p><p>Donal, Ellie's former lover, comes from an Irish family and knows the truth at the heart of the old myths. He thinks he can use the mask and the "hard men" for his own purposes. And Donal's sister, Miki, a punk accordion player, stands on the other side of the Gentry's battle with the Native spirits of the land. She knows that more than her brother's soul is at stake. All of Newford is threatened, human and mythic beings alike.</p><p>Once again Charles de Lint weaves the mythic traditions of many cultures into a seamless cloth, bringing folklore, music, and unforgettable characters to life on modern city streets.</p></p><p><i>Forests of the Heart</i> is an enthralling voyage into the seamier side of urban magic. Returning to the familiar environs of Newford, where he sets so many of his modern myths, Charles de Lint introduces some of his most memorable characters yet.<p> The Gentry are ancient spirits of the land, sired in rape and born of woman in the Old Country. When the Irish immigrated to the New World, some of the Gentry came along. Generations later, having no real ties to their new home, they dream dark dreams of wresting the land surrounding Newford from the native <i>manitou</i> spirits. The Gentry's scheming and plotting draw some of the inhabitants of Newford into a dark and desperate fight against them and a primeval spirit, old as the earth itself but slumbering in <i>la epoca del mito</i>, the myth time.</p><p> Bettina, a <i>curandera</i>--or healer--is part Mexican and part Indian. She has recently moved to Newford from the deserts of the Southwest for reasons she can't understand. She lives in Kellygnow, an art colony perched on a hill overlooking Newford. Earning her keep as a model for the various artists who live and work there, she tries to apply her desert-learned skills and knowledge in the cold, forested surroundings. </p><p> Bettina's fellow Kellygnowians include Nuala, who seems slightly more spiritual than the average housekeeper; Ellie, a sculptor with a very special commission; and the Recluse, a mysterious figure who winters at Kellygnow in one of the outlying private cottages. Donal, an Irish-born malcontent who dreams of better times, joins them, along with Miki, his musician sister, and Tommy, a Native American accompanied by a few of his apparently innumerable aunts. The looming battle against a seemingly invincible foe draws them together and forces them to depend not only upon their skills and powers, but also on hope, trust, and love.</p><p> Blending aspects of different cultural legends and myths with his keen insight into human nature, Charles de Lint offers a truly incredible and compelling tale. His specialty is an intoxicating mix of real and fantasy worlds, and <i>Forests of the Heart</i> delivers a delicious punch. With his deft touch and sensitive style, de Lint's mastery of the urban fantasy tale and his ability as a great storyteller remain unchallenged. <i>--Robert Gately</i></p><b>Charles de Lint</b> pioneered the urban fantasy genre with critically acclaimed novels and stories set in and around the imaginary modern North American city of Newford: <i>The Onion Girl</i>, <i>Moonheart</i>, <i>The Ivory and the Horn</i>, and the collection <i>Moonlight and Vines</i>, for which he won the World Fantasy Award.

They dictate how much water goes into your commode, and how much water comes out of your showerhead. They determine how hot the water needs to be in your washing machine, and how many miles to the gallon your car must achieve. Since the Patriot Act, your banking records, your gun registration, and your phone bill are easily accessible by government snoops. Mothers are arrested for buying raw milk. Families are fined for selling bunny rabbits without a license. Home and property owners are strapped with obscene fines, entangled in costly legal messes, and sent to federal prison, all for moving dirt from one end of their land to another. Unelected bureaucrats, armed with arbitrary rules and no need to back them up, stonewall and attack American citizens at every turn. The damage can be overwhelmingly taxing---financially, emotionally and even physically. <br><br>And who is being held accountable? Government regulation and red tape run amok in Washington, and honest, tax-paying citizens are the victims of an administration's misuse and abuse of power. Now, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, takes an in-depth look at the legislation that is trampling the rights of ordinary citizens, strangling their ability to conduct private, everyday activities without egregious government interference. He highlights outrageous searches, seizures and arrests, and points to thousands of regulations that have been added to the books since Obama took office. Most importantly, he charts a direction out of this mess, and toward renewed freedom for all Americans.<br><br>These stories are of everyday Americans badgered and harassed by their own government---the very institution that is supposed to serve us all.

Making his rounds from apartment to apartment, Moonbloom confronts a wildly varied assortment of brilliantly described urban characters, among them a gay jazz musician with a sideline as a gigolo, a Holocaust survivor, and a brilliant young black writer modeled on James Baldwin. Moonbloom hears their cries of outrage and abuse; he learns about their secret sorrows and desires.

Everything seemed empty. Beside her, supine and still, hands behind his head, lay a lean, light-boned man in his early forties, a few years older than herself. His eyes were closed, and remained closed as she folded back her own side of the floral-patterned duvet, rose quickly, put her feet into fur-lined slippers, drew a pink silk dressing gown around a figure in which breasts, stomach, thighs, were all a little over-ripe perhaps&#x2014;and stepped over to peer through the closed curtains.<br> &nbsp;<br> Had she consulted her Oxford University Pocket Diary, she would have noticed that the sun was due to set at 16.50 that early Wednesday evening in late October. The hour had gone back the previous week-end, and the nights, as they said, were pulling in fast She had always found difficulty with the goings back and forth of the clock&#x2014;until she had heard that simple little jingle on Radio Oxford: Spring Forward/Fall Back. That had pleased her. But already darkness had fallen outside, well before its time; and the rain still battered and rattled against the window-panes. The tarmac below was a glistening black, with a pool of orange light reflected from the street lamp opposite.<br> &nbsp;<br> When she was in her junior school, the class had been asked one afternoon to paint a scene on the Thames, and all the boys and girls had painted the river blue. Except her. And that was when the teacher had stopped the lesson (in midstream, as it were) and asserted that young Sheila was the only one of them who had the natural eye of an artist. Why? Because the Thames might well be grey or white or brown or green or yellow&#x2014;anything, in fact, except those little rectangles of Oxford blue and Cambridge blue and cobalt and ultramarine into which all the wetted brushes were dipping. So, would all of them please start again, and try to paint the colours they saw, and forget the postcards, forget the atlases? All of them, that is, except Sheila; for Sheila had painted the water black.<br> &nbsp;<br> And below her now the street was glistening black&nbsp;...&nbsp;Yes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everything seemed black.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sheila hugged the thin dressing gown around her and knew that he was awake; watching her; thinking of his wife, probably&#x2014;or of some other woman. Why didn&#x2019;t she just tell him to get out of her bed and out of her life? Was the truth that she needed him more than he needed her? It had not always been so.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was so very hard to say, but she said it: &#x201c;We were happy together till recently, weren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; The tongue tapped the teeth sharply at the final &#x201c;t&#x201d;.<br> &nbsp;<br> She turned now to look at him lying there, the moustache linking with the neatly trimmed Vandyke beard in a darkling circle around his mouth&#x2014;a mouth she sometimes saw as too small, and too prim, and, yes, too bloody conceited!<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I must go!&#x201d; Abruptly he sat up, swung his legs to the floor, and reached for his shirt.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We can see each other tomorrow?&#x201d; she asked softly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Difficult not to, won&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; He spoke with the clipped precision of an antique pedagogue, each of the five &#x201c;t&#x201d;s articulated with pedantic completion.

Couple of days a week? Could you manage that, Sheila?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He had dressed quickly, his slim fingers now fixing the maroon bow-tie into its usual decadent droop. For her part, she had nothing further to say; nothing she could say. She turned once again towards the window, soon to feel his hand on the back of her shoulders as he planted a perfunctory kiss at the nape of her neck. Then the door downstairs slammed. Miserably she watched the top of the black umbrella as it moved along the road. Then she turned off the bedside lamp, picked up the champagne bottle, and made her way down the stairs.<br> &nbsp;<br> She needed a drink.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Theodore Kemp strode along swiftly through the heavy rain towards his own house, only a few minutes&#x2019; walk away. He had already decided that there would be little, if any, furtherance of his affair with the readily devourable divorc�e he had just left. She was becoming a liability. He realised it might well have been his fault that she now seemed to require a double gin before starting her daily duties; that she took him so very seriously; that she was demanding more and more of his time; that she was prepared to take ever greater risks about their meetings. Well, he wasn&#x2019;t.

Bruno Latour announces his project dramatically: "Political ecology has nothing whatsoever to do with nature, this jumble of Greek philosophy, French Cartesianism and American parks." Nature, he asserts, far from being an obvious domain of reality, is a way of assembling political order without due process. Thus, his book proposes an end to the old dichotomy between nature and society--and the constitution, in its place, of a collective, a community incorporating humans and nonhumans and building on the experiences of the sciences as they are actually practiced.</p><p>In a critique of the distinction between fact and value, Latour suggests a redescription of the type of political philosophy implicated in such a "commonsense" division--which here reveals itself as distinctly uncommonsensical and in fact fatal to democracy and to a healthy development of the sciences. Moving beyond the modernist institutions of "mononaturalism" and "multiculturalism," Latour develops the idea of "multinaturalism," a complex collectivity determined not by outside experts claiming absolute reason but by "diplomats" who are flexible and open to experimentation.</p></p><p>From the book:What is to be done with political ecology? Nothing. What is to be done? Political ecology!All those who have hoped that the politics of nature would bring about a renewal of public life have asked the first question, while noting the stagnation of the so-called &#34;green&#34; movements. They would like very much to know why so promising an endeavor has so often come to naught. Appearances notwithstanding, everyone is bound to answer the second question the same way. We have no choice: politics does not fall neatly on one side of a divide and nature on the other. From the time the term &#34;politics&#34; was invented, every type of politics has been defined by its relation to nature, whose every feature, property, and function depends on the polemical will to limit, reform, establish, short-circuit, or enlighten public life. As a result, we cannot choose whether to engage in it surreptitiously, by distinguishing between questions of nature and questions of politics, or explicitly, by treating those two sets of questions as a single issue that arises for all collectives. While the ecology movements tell us that nature is rapidly invading politics, we shall have to imagine - most often aligning ourselves with these movements but sometimes against them - what a politics finally freed from the sword of Damocles we call nature might be like.<p>Bruno Latour is Professor at Sciences Po, Paris, and the 2013 winner of the Ludvig Holberg International Memorial Prize.</p></p><h2>Conservative Judaism</h2><p>A dynamic account of the creation and evolution of the Conservative movement over the last 100 years.

Making choices is what humans do. But individuals feel more personal autonomy and power to choose today than ever before in human history. In Choosing Change, author Peter Coutts acknowledges that clergy today recognize the impact our individualistic culture of choice is having on congregations. But Coutts also points out that many leaders do not think about motivation. For them, encouraging change is about selling their congregation on a new idea, governed by the assumption that a better idea should win the day. Wide experience in the church demonstrates that this approach often doesn&#39;t work and leaves many congregational leaders demoralized. Leaders see the need for change in their congregation, and they earnestly want to help their congregation to change. But the approach to leadership they learned, which perhaps worked better in days gone by, is no longer working. Leaders are in the motivation business, argues Coutts. Choosing Change provides an overview of current thinking from the field of motivation psychology. In the first half of the book, Coutts explores theories, ideas, and terms that are most pertinent for leaders who desire to encourage congregational change. The second half of the book offers detailed guidance for congregational leaders who want to be motivational leaders.</p><p>Peter Coutts has twenty-six years of congregational experience, including church planting and as lead minister of one of Canada&#39;s largest Presbyterian congregations. He has taught congregational revitalization as an adjunct professor in the D.Min. program at McCormick Seminary in Chicago. Currently Peter divides his time between coaching congregational pastors and leaders in 13 Presbyterian congregations in southern Alberta, and executive coaching and consulting in both congregational and business settings. Visit his website at http://www.choosingchange.ca/.Knowing about motivation, resistance, and human behavior can make the difference between squandering and embracing a future requiring change. Peter Coutts has provided a text rich in ideas, practices, and strategies that can open a fruitful future. (Gil Rendle, senior vice president, Texas Methodist Foundation; author of Doing the Math of Mission: Fruit, Faithfulness, and Metrics)<br><br>In an engaging combination of theory and story, Coutts addresses the vexing question, &#x2018;How do we actually get there?&#x2019; If you are guiding change in your faith community, this needs to be on your shelf. (John-Peter Smit, Congregational Development Consultant, Presbyterian Church in Canada)<br><br>The necessary science of motivation helps a pastor help a church to move from here to there, and from now to then in fulfilling its part in the mission of God. Choosing Change unlocks the keys to motivation, which unleashes the church to act with wisdom and<br>boldness. (Rev. George A. Mason, Senior Pastor, Wilshire Baptist Church)<br><br>Coutts&#x2019;s work is profoundly pastoral, savvy in its approach to change, and grounded in a rich variety of disciplines. It makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of congregational change. (Deborah J. Kapp, Edward F. and Phyllis K.

She just doesn't know it yet. </b></p><p>Ann Fletcher has returned to Charleston to see her younger sister Sarah receive her master's degree. But she soon finds herself riding in the back of an ambulance, watching helplessly as Sarah fights for her life. As they race to the hospital, Sarah talks to someone who is not there...and hums a melody Ann has never heard before.</p><p>That unfamiliar, unearthly beautiful melody keeps finding Ann--first in the hospital chapel, then in her dreams, and finally in Sarah's empty house.</p><p>Two neighbors have a profound effect on Ann. Ethan McKinney lends her a shoulder to lean on. And as a carpenter, he volunteers to help Ann get the Fletcher family home into shape for selling. His strong presence is a pleasing distraction. Ann's twelve-year-old neighbor, Keith, has Down Syndrome and the guile to believe he can actually see and hear angels. In fact, he insists they are looking out for her in ways she's never imagined.</p><p>God begins to reveal himself to Ann--both in her newfound friends and through supernatural events. As she discovers the very real presence of angels around her, will she finally open her heart to receive God's healing love?</p></p><p><b>Sheila Walsh, </b>Women of Faith� speaker, is the author of the award-winning Gigi, God's Little Princess� series, <i>The Shelter of God's Promises</i>,<i> </i>and&nbsp;a new fiction novel, <i>Sweet Sanctuary</i>. Sheila lives in&nbsp;Texas with her husband, Barry, and son, Christian.Women of Faith speaker Walsh (Beautiful Things Happen When a Woman Trusts God) and novelist Cushman (Leaving Yesterday) have co-authored a yarn about a young woman's unawareness of angels surrounding her every move. Annie Fletcher has returned home to Charleston, S.C., from her busy life as a New York designer to celebrate her younger sister Sarah's graduation when Sarah dies in an auto accident. Distraught and feeling more alone than ever, Annie begins to have dreams and hear music--angelic music--and does her level best to escape it. When her deceased sister's neighbors come calling, Annie gets even more uneasy as 12-year-old Keith, who has Down syndrome, starts talking about seeing angels all around. Troubled and scared, Annie fights memories of a painful childhood even as she battles present-day business adversaries and internally rebels against evidence in her life of invisible angelic protectors. Walsh is known for communicating with real depth in her nonfiction titles; sadly, this fictional offering isn't as riveting. Many of the story's angelic occurrences are more contrived than divine. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Despite her own family connections to the IRA, she travelled north largely unfettered by sectarian loyalties. Armed instead with an indefatigable curiosity, a fine ear for anecdote, an ability to stand her own at the bar, and a penetrating intelligence, she navigated her way through horrifying situations, and sometimes found herself among people stiff with hate and grief. But equally, she discovered an unquenchable thirst for life and peace, a spirit that refused to die.</p><p>Dervla Murphy (born Lismore, County Waterford, 1931) was determined to write, not to marry, and to travel to India. She realised two of these ambitions in Full Tilt, her first book, which describes her exuberant bicycle ride from Lismore - where she still lives - to India, through Iran and Afghanistan. It has been followed by some twenty further titles, including an acclaimed memoir, Wheels within Wheels. Her most recent book is A Month by the Sea: Encounters in Gaza.Genial, tolerant and affectionate.

Wherever they take root, weeds compete for resources, and most often win. They also wreak havoc on industry&#x2014;from agriculture to golf courses to civic landscape projects, vast amounts of money are spent to eradicate these virile and versatile invaders. With so much at stake, reliable information on weeds and their characteristics is crucial. Richard Dickinson and France Royer shed light on this complex world with <i>Weeds of North America, </i>the essential reference for all who wish to understand the science of the all-powerful weed.<br>Encyclopedic in scope, the book is the first to cover North American weeds at every stage of growth. The book is organized by plant family, and more than five hundred species are featured. Each receives a two-page spread with images and text identification keys.

This beautiful and comprehensive volume--with more than one hundred color and almost eighty black-and-white plates--is the most ambitious ever devoted to his work. It is being published in conjunction with a major retrospective of the artist's work.</p><br><p> A biographical overview and a detailed chronology by the artist's grandson, including charming vintage photographs, provide much new information and correct several misconceptions about Frieseke's life and career. Three invaluable essays by leading scholars discuss the diverse stages of his work and place it in art historical context, detailing his experience as a student at Whistler's atelier in Paris and as a central member of the group of American expatriates who settled in Giverny, France, near the French master Monet. The book's groundbreaking scholarship casts new light on Frieseke, American Impressionism, and the art world at the turn of the last century.</p><br><p> The contributors are Nicholas Kilmer, guest curator of the exhibition and the artist's grandson; Virginia M.

Nicholas Kilmer, Frieseke's grandson, contributes a biographical narrative that includes many personal letters and archival family photographs, and three noted scholars of American art (Barbara Weinberg, Virginia M. Meklenburg, and David Sellin) address the artist's stylistic tendencies. Their essays move chronologically through Frieseke's career, discussing his style from the period before 1910; his stays in Le Pouldu, Brittany in 1901 and in Giverny in 1905-20; and his last artistic phase, which lasted from the 1920s until his death in 1939. The authors examine the paintings produced at the height of Frieseke's Impressionist phase at Giverny not only in terms of Impressionist effects of color and light but also in relation to the decorative qualities of line, texture, and interlocking figures seen in the Nabis and Art Nouveau styles. They go on to point out the characteristics of Frieseke's lesser-known late paintings, which utilize a new realism, a less sensual line, harder edges, and modern dress.

Included are ways to simplify problems, tricks for special instances, and explanations of common numerical systems like measurements, calendars, time zones, and prices. One disappointment is that no explanation is offered for some of the most interesting calculation tricks work. Still, in the hands of an enthusiastic teacher, many of these ideas could add excitement to math class. This is a school-oriented pre-algebra course with a little consumer math thrown in.

The explorers had gone without food for one day, then two. Their leader, not yet thirty, drove on, determined to ascend the great mountain. Waist deep in snow, he reluctantly turned back. But Zebulon Pike had not been defeated. His name remained on the unclimbed peak-and new adventures lay ahead of him and his republic.<br><br>In <em>Citizen Explorer</em>, historian Jared Orsi provides the first modern biography of this soldier and explorer, who rivaled contemporaries Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Born in 1779, Pike joined the army and served in frontier posts in the Ohio River valley before embarking on a series of astonishing expeditions. He sought the headwaters of the Mississippi and later the sources of the Arkansas and Red Rivers, which led him to Pike's Peak and capture by Spanish forces. Along the way, he met Aaron Burr and General James Wilkinson; Auguste and Pierre Couteau, patriarchs of St. Louis's most powerful fur-trading family, who sought to make themselves indispensible to Jefferson's administration; as well as British fur-traders, Native Americans, and officers of the Spanish empire, all of whom resisted the expansion of the United States. Through Pike's life, Orsi examines how American nationalism thinned as it stretched west, from the Jeffersonian idealism on the Atlantic to a practical, materialist sensibility on the frontier. Surveying and gathering data, Pike sought to incorporate these distant territories into the republic, to overlay the west with the American map grid; yet he became increasingly dependent for survival on people who had no attachment to the nation he served. He eventually died in that service, in a victorious battle in the War of 1812. <br><br>Written from an environmental perspective, rich in cultural and political context, <em>Citizen Explorer</em> is a state-of-the-art biography of a remarkable man.<br></p><p><p><b> A Look Inside: <em>Citizen Explorer: The Life of Zebulon Pike</em> [Click Images to Enlarge]</b></p> Reconstructed soldiers&#x2019; barracks as they might have looked ca. 1802.

It is a brillant portrait of an ordinary, complicated, impossible man whom Mordecai Richler has made uniquely memorable for all time.</p><p>Barney Panofsky smokes too many cigars, drinks too much whiskey, and is obsessed with two things: the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and his ex-wife Miriam. An acquaintance from his youthful years in Paris, Terry McIver, is about to publish his autobiography. In its pages he accuses Barney of an assortment of sins, including murder. It's time, Barney decides, to present the world with his own version of events. <i>Barney's Version</i> is his memoir, a rambling, digressive rant, full of revisions and factual errors (corrected in footnotes written by his son) and enough insults for everyone, particularly vegetarians and Quebec separatists. <p> But Barney does get around to telling his life story, a desperately funny but sad series of bungled relationships. His first wife, an artist and poet, commits suicide and becomes--� la Sylvia Plath--a feminist icon, and Barney is widely reviled for goading her toward death, if not actually murdering her. He marries the second Mrs. Panofsky, whom he calls a "Jewish-Canadian Princess," as an antidote to the first; it turns out to be a horrible mistake. The third, "Miriam, my heart's desire," is quite possibly his soul mate, but Barney botches this one, too. It's painful to watch him ruin everything, and even more painful to bear witness to his deteriorating memory. The mystery at the heart of Barney's story--did he or did he not kill his friend Boogie?--provides enough forward momentum to propel the reader through endless digressions, all three wives, and every one of Barney's nearly heartbreaking episodes of forgetfulness. <i>Barney's Version</i>, winner of Canada's 1997 Giller Prize, is Richler's 10th novel, and a dense, energetic, and ultimately poignant read. <i>--R. Ellis</i></p>"Contains not a page without its laugh and not a paragraph without its smile...Richler is the funniest novelist at present at work in the English language."<br>--Francis King, The Spectator<br><br>"Like Dr. Johnson at his insulting best, Barney at the top of his form is unsurpassed...Richler has written a Lear for our selfish, penny-pinching times, a Lear uncluttered by divided kingdoms and quarreling daughters. Even the Fool is dispensed with. Barney is his own Fool."<br>--Alberto Manguel, Sunday Times<br><br>"Moving, funny, combative...What more could Booker judges and commentators---or anybody else--want from a novel?"<br>--James Walton, Daily Telegraph<br><br>"Exuberant, melancholy, literary outpouring from Richler at his best."<br>--Judy Cooke, Mail on Sunday<br><br>"The curmudgeonly, unregenerately boozy, caustic old rogue Barney Panofsky is Mordecai Richler's inspired antidote to political correctness, yoofiness, and all forms of contemporary smugness and pedantry...Richler is magisterially in command of his material."<br>--Katy Emick, The Guardian<br><br>"The funniest book of the year, and maybe the saddest...Mordecai Richler has never written with greater voice."<br>--Tom Adair, Scotland on Sunday</p><h2>The Venetians (Italian Histories)</h2><p><p><strong>A colorful new history of Venice that illuminates the character of the great city-state by shining a light on some of the most celebrated personalities of European history&#x2015;Petrarch, Marco Polo, Galileo, Titian, Vivaldi, and Casanova.</strong></p><p>The Republic of Venice was the first great economic, cultural, and naval power of the modern Western world.&nbsp; After winning the struggle for ascendency in the late 13th century, the Republic enjoyed centuries of unprecedented glory and built a trading empire which at its apogee reached as far afield as China, Syria and West Africa. This golden period only drew to an end with the Republic&#x2019;s eventual surrender to Napoleon.</p><p><em>The Venetians</em> illuminates the character of the Republic during these illustrious years by shining a light on some of the most celebrated personalities of European history&#x2015;Petrarch, Marco Polo, Galileo, Titian, Vivaldi, Casanova. Frequently, though, these emblems of the city found themselves at odds with the Venetian authorities who prized stability above all else, and were notoriously suspicious of any "cult of personality." Was this very tension perhaps the engine for the Republic&#x2019;s unprecedented rise?</p><p>Rich with biographies of some of the most exalted characters who have ever lived, <em>The Venetians</em> is a refreshing and authoritative new look at the history of the most evocative of city states.</p> 16 pages of B&amp;W and color photographs</p><p>Paul Strathern is a Somerset Maugham Award&#x2013;winning novelist, and his nonfiction works include The Venetians,&nbsp;Death in Florence, and The Medici, all available from Pegasus Books. He lives in England.The city-state of Venice, situated on islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic, maintained its independence for more than a millennium, until the Napoleonic Age. Blessed by its location, it dominated the east-west trade routes that linked the medieval West with the Byzantine Empire and points further east. During the Renaissance, it became one of the glittering cultural jewels of northern Italy. Strathern attempts to explain the growth and magnificence of Venice by concentrating on the lives of some of the historical figures who played prominent roles in its development, from Marco Polo to the famed adventurer, lover, and literary icon Casanova. This is an enjoyable journey filled with interesting tidbits about both well-known and relatively obscure characters who left their mark on the city. Strathern also delves into the often mysterious and confusing manner in which Venice was governed by a small core of elite citizens. As serious history, however, this survey falls short since it fails to link the city with broader historical trends and ignores many aspects of Venetian political and cultural development. Still, this work can serve as a useful and informative introduction for general readers. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture</h2><p>Agroecology is defined as the application of ecological concepts and principles to the design and management of sustainable agroecosystems.

John Granger, a devout Christian, teacher of classic literature, and father of seven children, first read the Harry Potter books so he could explain to his children why they weren't allowed to read them. After intense study, however, he became convinced that the books are underestimated as literature--and reflect important Christian truths. In <i>Looking for God in Harry Potter,</i> Granger gives parents and teachers a roadmap for using the Harry Potter books to teach Christian truth to children.</p><p>This production is an effective synergy of writer and reader. While a few of his interpretations are contrived, for the most part, John Granger approaches the Harry Potter novels with focused intelligence, scholarship, and wit. This wit, along with Granger's personal asides and the illustrative quotations from the novels, is what narrator Nick Sandys builds on to make his delivery a delight. Sandys enters fully into Granger's perspective, sounding first dubious about Harry Potter's moral importance, then gleefully surprised. Sandys knows how to evoke individual characters well through shifts in tone, and when to linger, as both Granger and J.K. Rowling do, for emphasis. G.T.B. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Granger (no relation to fellow brainiac Hermione), a homeschooling Christian father of seven, initially resisted when a friend encouraged him to read the Harry Potter books. But Rowling's novels, sprinkled with literary allusions and strong biblical values, won the classicist over quickly, and he became an avid spokesperson for the series. This book transcends the responses of some other Christian writers (those in support, like Connie Neal, or in sloppy accusations, like Richard Abanes) to offer a serious literary and Christian appraisal of the first five books. Granger begins with the thesis that all humans are "wired" to respond to "stories that reflect the greatest story ever told," including that of Harry's struggle against evil. The best part of the book is Granger's lucid commentary on Rowling's use of language&#x2014;the insights into character names alone are worth the price of admission&#x2014;and his keen awareness of word play. Although some arguments are a stretch, and there are a few tiny mistakes (in a footnote, for example, Granger claims that the hero of <i>James and the Giant Peach</i> was named James Potter, like Harry's dad, when it was James Henry Trotter), this is obviously a painstakingly researched book. It is easily the best examination to date of the spiritual legacy of "the boy who lived." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn.

His skill in defending and explaining the Faith was honed during the early 1900s, when he began his mission work to non-Catholics, often attending Klu Klux Klan and other anti-Catholic rallies in order to directly confront the speakers and attendees. He launched what has become one of the largest Catholic publishing houses in the world, Our Sunday Visitor. In addition to creating a national Catholic newspaper and distributing millions of topical pamphlets on the Faith, he published several books, among which <b>Father Smith Instructs Jackson</b> quickly became a best-seller. He earned the honorary title of Archbishop as a sign of the Vatican's esteem for his work.</p><h2>Mysticism Sacred and Profane</h2><p>An Inquiry into some Varieties of Praeternatural Experience.</p><p></p><h2>A Neotropical Companion</h2><p><p>A<i> Neotropical Companion</i> is an extraordinarily readable introduction to the American tropics, the lands of Central and South America, their remarkable rainforests and other ecosystems, and the creatures that live there. It is the most comprehensive one-volume guide to the Neotropics available today. Widely praised in its first edition, it remains a book of unparalleled value to tourists, students, and scientists alike. This second edition has been substantially revised and expanded to incorporate the abundance of new scientific information that has been produced since it was first published in 1989. Major additions have been made to every chapter, and new chapters have been added on Neotropical ecosystems, human ecology, and the effects of deforestation. Biodiversity and its preservation are discussed throughout the book, and Neotropical evolution is described in detail. This new edition offers all new drawings and photographs, many of them in color.</p><br><p> As enthusiastic readers of the first edition will attest, this is a charming book. Wearing his learning lightly and writing with ease and humor, John Kricher presents the complexities of tropical ecology as accessible and nonintimidating. Kricher is so thoroughly knowledgeable and the book is so complete in its coverage that general readers and ecotourists will not need any other book to help them identify and understand the plants and animals, from birds to bugs, that they will encounter in their travels to the New World tropics. At the same time, it will fascinate armchair travelers and students who may get no closer to the Neotropics than this engagingly written book.</p></p><p>A second revised edition of John Kricher's well-received 1989 text, <i>A Neotropical Companion</i> distills whole libraries of information on the Americas' tropics. Kricher explores the workings of a rainforest with admirable clarity, discussing matters such as regeneration pathways and ecological succession. He also takes a sidelong glance at current issues in evolutionary theory, using his deep knowledge of the tropics to add to the literature on speciation and various hypotheses surrounding it. Ethnobotanists in particular will want to have a look at Kricher's catalog of tropical medicinal plants, in which lie the promise of cures and reliefs for a host of modern illnesses.<b>John Kricher</b> is Professor of Biology at Wheaton College, where he is the first recipient of the Bojan Hamlin Jennings Chair in the Natural Sciences and Mathematics.

What did so many creative minds find in scripture? Is the Bible still a vital source of poetic inspirations?<br> <em>Chapters Into Verse</em> is the first comprehensive collection ever made of poems written in English inspired by the Bible. A groundbreaking anthology, it introduces readers to a distinct heritage of English poetry: the scriptural tradition. Though frequently ignored and sometimes suppressed, this tradition rivals the classical and is every bit as venerable.<br> Drawing a unique map of the history of English poetry, the two volumes of <em>Chapters Into Verse</em> survey and define the literary legacy of the Scriptures from the fourteenth century to the present. Each volume is arranged in scriptural order, and each poem is preceded by the biblical passage that inspired it. Thus readers can conveniently witness the various ways sacred text has sparked the imagination of poets throughout the ages.<br> In Volume I, which covers <em>Genesis</em> to <em>Malachi</em>, almost every book of the Old Testament is represented. The collection features verses both famous and unfamiliar, from Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em> and Lord Byron's <em>Hebrew Melodies</em> to Christopher Smart's hymns and Mary Herbert's psalms. The editors have included poems by virtually all the prominent religious poets--among them, John Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, Edward Taylor, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Included, too, are devotional and visionary works from a wide range of vintage poets--Robert Burns, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, Alfred Tennyson, and Robert Browning.<br> Proving that the Bible is just as powerful a source of inspiration today as it was in the past, the collection assembles a mixed congregation of modern and contemporary poets, such as Marianne Moore, Delmore Schwartz, Dylan Thomas, Robert Frost, William Carlos Williams, Countee Cullen, e.e. cummings, William Butler Yeats, Robert Lowell, Hugh McDiarmid, Laura (Riding) Jackson, Charles Reznikoff, A.D. Hope, Geoffrey Hill, Denise Levertov, Philip Levine, John Ashbery, and Derek Walcott.<br> Of enduring interest to readers of both scripture and literature, this anthology illuminates key passages of the Old Testament. The measured speech and inspired leaps of poetry offer a spirited alternative to the textual exegesis usually supplied by prose commentary. As such, Chapters Into Verse is truly a poets' Bible. In selection after selection, readers will encounter an astonishing variety of religious experiences, as a host of poets from many eras and many backgrounds respond to Holy Scripture spiritually, profoundly, and imaginatively.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert Atwan</strong> is founder and series editor of the annual <em>Best American Essays</em>. The editor of numerous anthologies, he has written on the ancient literature of the Near East and his critical essays and poetry reviews have appeared in many national periodicals. <strong>Laurance Wieder</strong> is the author of several volumes of poetry, including <em>The Coronet of Tours</em>; <em>No Harm Done</em>; <em>The Last Century: Selected Poems</em>; and <em>One Hundred Fifty Psalms</em>, a complete psalter. He has taught Bible and Ancient Authors at Cornell University.<br>Astonishing that no one has come up with this idea before! Editors Atwan and Wieder have compiled an anthology of poems from all eras, styles, and degree of reverence, which take as their major inspiration lines, verses, or chapters from the Bible. Arranged in biblical order in two volumes (Old and New Testaments), the poems are preceded by the appropriate chapters and verses (the King James version has been used throughout). Poets as wide-ranging as Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, and Delmore Schwartz are interspersed with D.H. Lawrence and writers from the Harlem Renaissance.The editors limited their selection of poems to those of distinctive literary merit, rather than sentimentality or sanctimonious fervor, and to those that derived from one identifiable scriptural source. The result is a two-volume work that elucidates and sometimes contradicts the writings that form the basis of Judeo-Christian belief. To read these Scripture passages and the poems that follow them is to take an unusual, reflective journey through the Bible and through the history of English poetry.

In this pioneering history, Nancy F. Cott demonstrates that marriage is and always has been a public institution.</p><p>From the founding of the United States to the present day, imperatives about the necessity of marriage and its proper form have been deeply embedded in national policy, law, and political rhetoric. Legislators and judges have envisioned and enforced their preferred model of consensual, lifelong monogamy--a model derived from Christian tenets and the English common law that posits the husband as provider and the wife as dependent.In early confrontations with Native Americans, emancipated slaves, Mormon polygamists, and immigrant spouses, through the invention of the New Deal, federal income tax, and welfare programs, the federal government consistently influenced the shape of marriages. And even the immense social and legal changes of the last third of the twentieth century have not unraveled official reliance on marriage as a "pillar of the state."</p><p>By excluding some kinds of marriages and encouraging others, marital policies have helped to sculpt the nation's citizenry, as well as its moral and social standards, and have directly affected national understandings of gender roles and racial difference. <i>Public Vows</i> is a panoramic view of marriage's political history, revealing the national government's profound role in our most private of choices. No one who reads this book will think of marriage in the same way again.</p></p><p>Nancy F. Cott is Professor of History at Harvard University.&#x201c;In showing how marriage has always been regulated and shaped by the state, Nancy Cott not only recasts our understanding of this most intimate of relationships but enables us to think in new ways about concepts of privacy, public power, and, ultimately, liberty itself in American history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Foner, author of <i>The Story of American Freedom</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With <i>Public Vows</i>, Nancy Cott provides the most powerful and thorough account of the evolution of marriage as a legal and social practice in this country, and as a consistent focus of public regulation and political concern. This engaging and lucid book should be on the required reading list of every serious observer of American politics as well as students of social history, marriage, and the family. Cott offers a lens onto racial, religious, and ethnic conflicts, along with a compelling argument that the public uses of marriage can include preservation of a sacred space for private meanings.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martha Minow, Harvard Law School</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Public Vows</i> is an extraordinary accomplishment. Nancy Cott definitively establishes the public character of the 'private' institution of marriage in American history. More, she reveals how the American image of monogamy has been infused into laws, social issues and political debates in ways and to an extent one never would have imagined. The book is insightful, imaginatively and thoroughly researched, and convincing. Reading it compelled me to expand and improve my understandings of the institution of marriage.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Neil J. Smelser, Director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Public Vows</i> is a <i>tour de force</i>, a wide-ranging history of marriage from the era of the American Revolution to the era of President Clinton's impeachment and the 'Defense of Marriage Act.'

Heilbrun, author of <i>Writing a Woman's Life</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this exhaustively researched study...[Cott] posits a monolithic Christian monogamous marriage, formed by the mutual consent of a man and a woman, as American colonists' model. This model, she argues, was congruent with the political ideal of representative government: the Constitution's 'more perfect union' was likened to the domestic ideal of marital union. Entry to marriage, Cott observes, has been regulated by the states, which have also used their power to limit this civil right.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this fascinating study, Cott examines the evolution and impact of marriage law on the American social structure...Presented in a clear, chronological fashion, this work provides a wealth of thought-provoking information. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rose Cichy</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Christian monogamy and property rights have been crucial to state and federal policies on marriage ever since the American republic was born, and how Americans have felt about marriage has affected much larger developments than the joining of one man and one woman in matrimony...[According to <i>Public Vows</i>,] marriage is now much less a matter of public policy--an institution--than one of private accommodation--a contract. Cott's cool, intelligent overview is sometimes demanding but always absorbing.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ray Olson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As a historian, Nancy Cott is not obligated to look into the future.

But which Jedi Knight? While the ex-storm trooper turned Rebel spy Kyle Katarn is the ostensible hero of the three books, his father is also a Jedi Knight of sorts. Kyle has done the impossible and trained himself in the way of the Force, but readers learn that his father had also glimpsed the Jedi way and had turned back. In addition, the novel is populated with a number of Dark Jedi, notably Yun, who sometimes question their Dark path. And then there are the Jedi Masters--Rahn and Luke Skywalker--who stand literally and figuratively as spiritual guides to Kyle. Finally, there is the Valley of the Jedi. The Valley is the heart of the book: Dark Jedi Jerec wants to harness its concentration of the Force for his dreams of interstellar domination; and the Jedi Rebels want to protect it or destroy it before it falls into the Empire's hands. As Kyle races his Dark Side counterparts to the secret of the Valley, readers will recall the best mythic moments (Luke's attack on the first Death Star or his final duel with Darth Vader) from the <i>Star Wars</i> films.<p> In the end, <i>Jedi Knight</i> is a short novel of epic proportions that neatly ties up the many threads presented in Dietz's first two installments (<i>Soldier for the Empire</i> and <i>Rebel Agent</i>). Eisner-winning artist Dave Dorman brings Kyle and his love, Jan, to vivid life in his series of painted scenes scattered throughout the text. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>William C.

With more than 50,000 copies sold, the first edition has helped thousands of developers improve their C++ programming skills. Continuing in this tradition, Meyers has reworked every item in the book and has liberally placed cross-references throughout the text.</p><p>This exceptionally useful text offers Scott Myers's expertise in C++ class design and programming tips. The second edition incorporates recent advances to C++ included in the ISO standard, including namespaces and built-in template classes, and is required reading for any working C++ developer.<p> The book opens with some hints for porting code from C to C++ and then moves on to the proper use of the <i>new</i> and <i>delete</i> operators in C++ for more robust memory management. The text then proceeds to class design, including the proper use of constructors, destructors, and overloaded operator functions for assignment within classes. (These guidelines ensure that you will create custom C++ classes that are fully functional data types, which can be copied and assigned just like built-in C++ classes.)</p><p> The author also provides a handful of suggestions for general class design, including strategies for using different types of inheritance and encapsulation. Never doctrinaire and always intelligent, these guidelines can make your C++ classes more robust and easier to maintain. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p>The first edition of <i>Effective C++</i> sold nearly 100,000 copies and was translated into four languages. It's easy to understand why. Scott Meyers' practical approach to C++ described the rules of thumb employed by the experts--the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing--to produce clear, correct, efficient code.</p> <p> Each of this book's 50 guidelines summarizes a way to write better C++, and the accompanying discussions are backed by specific examples. For this new edition, Meyers reworked every guideline in the book. The result is exceptional adherence to C++'s Draft International Standard, current compiler technology, and the latest insights into the use of C++ for real-world applications.</p> <p> Highlights of <i>Effective C++</i>, Second Edition include:</p> <ul> <li> Expert guidance on object-oriented design, class design, and the proper use of inheritance </li><li> An examination of the standard C++ library, including how the Standard Template Library and classes like string and vector affect the structure of well-written programs </li><li>Discussions of late-breaking language features like in-class constant initializations, namespaces, and member templates </li><li>Wisdom usually possessed by only the most experienced developers </li></ul> <i>Effective C++</i> continues to be essential reading for every developer working with C++. <br><br> 0201924889B04062001</p><h2>Essentials of Clinical Geriatrics 7/E</h2><p><p><b>An engaging introductory guide to the core topics in geriatric medicine</b></p><p><strong>A Doody's Core Title for 2017!</strong></p><p><i>&#x201c;This is a valuable reference for those treating geriatric patients, providing well-reasoned expectations.

National Book Award - winner Charles Johnson offers a passionate discussion of the writer&#39;s apprenticeship. Lan Samantha Chang, author of the acclaimed story collection Hunger, presents strategies for structuring stories. John Barth, one of the most influential writers and theorists of the past forty years, explores elements of storytelling. Creating Fiction is a partnership between Story Press and the Associated Writing Programs, an organization of nearly three hundred college and university writing programs. The contributors, members of the AWP, have taught thousands of students the art and craft of telling stories. Now their experience and wisdom can be found in one comprehensive book.</p><p>Unable to secure a coveted spot in a creative-writing program? Unwilling to make the life changes necessary to do so? <i>Creating Fiction</i> is a fiction-writing course from some of those programs' top instructors. Among the finest of these 23 never-before-published essays about fiction writing--each of which is accompanied by a few writing exercises--are those by Jane Smiley on revision, John Barth on plot, Carrie Brown on the writing of magic realism, and Julie Checkoway on "The Lingerie Theory of Literature" ("The fundamental secret ... to the effective ending," Checkoway confides, "is to practice the restraint one sees in those Victoria's Secret lingerie ads--enough coyness to tantalize, enough enigma to tease, but never, ever, too much naked abandon").<p> And Philip Gerard, author of <i>Hatteras Light</i> and instructor at UNC-Wilmington, has written a standout piece about structuring the novel and story collection. "It astonishes me," says Gerard, "that intelligent people who would not hold a wedding, plant a garden, or even slap together a utility shed without exhaustive planning nonetheless regard the novel as a spontaneous literary event that just happens onto the page." Of course, there are many novelists who would disagree with Gerard about such planning, but Gerard is not advocating writing an outline and sticking to it. "The central paradox of writing the novel," he says, is that "you have to know where it's going, but when it speaks to you, shows you a better direction, you have to be ready to abandon your plan and listen to the story." Gerard also has unorthodox ideas on the organizing of story collections. While most writers obsess over story arrangement, Gerard's approach is more relaxed. "Enough readers read at random within the collection," he advises, "that worrying too much about the order of stories may distract the writer and editor from more important considerations." And whatever you do, don't be overwhelmed by the concept of writing a book. "Nobody writes a book," says Gerard. "What you write every day is a piece of a book, a fragment, a scene." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Julie Checkoway is the head of the creative writing program at the University of Georgia and was the 1998-1999 president of the Associated Writing Programs.

Well known in the Orthodox Jewish world, Mussar is an illuminating, approachable, and highly practical set of teachings for cultivating personal growth and spiritual realization in the midst of day-to-day life. The ultimate goal of Mussar is to become a more whole and holy person. The path is simple: learn to be a mensch, a deeply good and decent human being, or what has been called an "extraordinary ordinary person." <br><br>The core teaching of Mussar is that our deepest essence is inherently pure and holy, but this inner radiance is obscured by extremes of emotion, desire, and bad habits. Our work in life is to uncover the brilliant light of the soul. The Mussar masters developed transformative teachings and practices&#x2014;some of which are contemplative, some of which focus on how we relate to others in daily life&#x2014;to help us to heal and refine ourselves.&nbsp; <br><br>Alan Morinis, founder of the Mussar Institute, presents these teachings in terms that anyone can understand and put to use. <i>Everyday Holiness&nbsp;</i> features short chapters on eighteen key character traits that the Mussar masters emphasize, including humility, generosity, gratitude, trust, patience, and enthusiasm. Morinis also explains how to make Mussar practice part of our daily lives. Here is a welcome resource for all those who are interested in reinvigorating their religious lives, exploring contemplative spirituality, and making spirituality part of everyday life. <br><br>For more information on Mussar and the author, Alan Morinis, visit www.mussarinstitute.org.</p><p>Alan Morinis completed his doctorate at Oxford University, which he attended on a Rhodes Scholarship.

Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A.

Here are Gospel-minded pastors and scholars doing Gospel business from all the scriptures&#x2015;this is a biblical and theological feast preparing God&#x2019;s people to apply the entire Bible to all of life with heart and mind wholly committed to Christ&#x2019;s priorities.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bryan Chapell</strong><strong>,</strong> Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church, Peoria, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;Mark Twain may have smiled when he wrote to a friend, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long letter.&#x201d; But the truth of Twain&#x2019;s remark remains serious and universal, because well-reasoned, compact writing requires extra time and extra hard work. And this is what we have in the Crossway Bible study series <em>Knowing the Bible</em>&#x2015;as the skilled authors and notable editors provide the contours of each book of the Bible as well as the grand theological themes that bind them together as one Book. Here, in a 12-week format, are carefully wrought studies that will ignite the mind and the heart.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>R. Kent Hughes</strong><strong>, </strong>Professor of Practical Theology, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Knowing the Bible</em> brings together a gifted team of Bible teachers to produce a high quality series of study guides. The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Wheaton College; author, <em>Loving the Way Jesus Loves</em></p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy</strong><strong>,</strong> former lecturer in Old Testament, biblical theology, and hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A.

Assemblywomen. Wealth. (Loeb Classical Library No. 180)</h2><p><p>Aristophanes, one of the world's greatest comic dramatists, has been admired since antiquity for his iridescent wit and beguiling fantasy, exuberant language, and brilliant satire of the social, intellectual, and political life of Athens at its height. This is the fourth and final volume in the new Loeb Classical Library edition of his plays.</p><p><i>Frogs</i> was produced in 405 BCE, shortly after the deaths of Sophocles and Euripides. Dionysus, the patron god of theater, journeys to the underworld to retrieve Euripides. There he is recruited to judge a contest between the traditional Aeschylus and the modern Euripides, a contest that yields both sparkling comedy and insight on ancient literary taste. In<i> Assemblywomen</i> Athenian women plot to save Athens from male misgovernance. They transfer power to themselves and institute a new social order in which all inequalities based on wealth, age, and beauty are eliminated&#x2014;with raucously comical results. The gentle humor and straightforward morality of<i> Wealth</i> made it the most popular of Aristophanes' plays from classical times to the Renaissance. Here the god Wealth is cured of his blindness; his newfound ability to distinguish good people from bad brings playfully portrayed social consequences.</p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Henderson is William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Boston University.

We know it&#39;s the most significant thing we can do and that sharing it is the most important gift we could ever give to a friend. Yet evangelism remains one of the most frustrating parts of the Christian life. Until now. Bill Hybels and Mark Mittelberg believe that it doesn&#39;t have to be that way; effectively communicating our faith in Jesus Christ should be the most natural thing in the world. What we need, however, is encouragement and direction. In Becoming a Contagious Christian Hybels and Mittelberg offer a practical plan of action for touching the lives of friends, family members, and others, illustrated with powerful, real-life stories. Their emphasis is clear: be yourself in Christ, find a style that works for you. Hybels and Mittelberg use simple, straightforward language and diverse biblical characters such as Paul, Dorcas, and the Samaritan woman to encourage us with the good news that God knew what he was doing when he made each of us. As a result, all of us can impact our world for Christ. It is an approach the authors have seen work again and again at Willow Creek Community Church. They articulate the important principles that have helped the believers at Willow Creek become a church of &#39;contagious Christians,&#39; a church known around the world for its outstanding and effective outreach to the unchurched. Becoming a Contagious Christian may well be one of the most important contributions to relational evangelism in decades. It presents a blueprint for starting a spiritual epidemic of hope and enthusiasm for spreading the Gospel of Christ.</p><p>Bill Hybels, founder and pastor of Willow Creek Community Church, is the author of several books, including Honest to God?, Too Busy Not to Pray, and the previous titles in the Interactions series.

Katsenelson</strong> <br><br><b>What approach do you recommend taking in sideways markets?</b> <br>What I propose in the book (and practice in life) is active value investing. Instead of being a market timer, I&#x2019;m a buy-and-sell investor, with a focus on valuing individual stocks. <p>Find stocks that lie within your circle of competence, analyze them as to whether they meet your qualitative criteria (such as competitive advantage, strong balance sheet, high return on capital, shareholder-friendly management. etc.), value them, determine an appropriate margin of safety (discount to fair value, which should be increased in range-bound markets), and you&#x2019;ll thereby arrive at a price at which you&#x2019;d want to buy them. </p> <p>If a stock trades at or below your buy price, buy it; if not, put it on your watch list. When the stock reaches your fair-value level, you don&#x2019;t hold it, you sell it. Repeat this process over and over again. </p> <b>What is one piece of advice you&#x2019;d give to readers about investing in sideways markets? </b> <br>An investor makes money from stock appreciation and dividends. Stock appreciation is driven by P/E expansion and earnings/cash flows growth. If you see an apparent catalyst (news or event) that will force P/E to go up &#x2013; great! But in my experience I found that it is the apparent absence of a catalyst that creates an undervaluation. Wall Street is fairly short-term oriented, therefore if the stock is undervalued but there is no reason or a catalyst to help it go up in the next quarter or two, it gets dumped. <p>Here is what I propose. Buy stocks that grow earnings and pay dividends, this will put time on your side -- you are getting paid to wait. </p> <p>Earnings growth is compressing P/E under the stock and dividends are a real time payment for your patience. If a company doesn&#x2019;t grow earnings and pays little dividend, make sure undervaluation (potential P/E expansion) is significant, or there is a clear catalyst, as time is not on your side in this case. For instance, if you find a stock that is 20 percent undervalued, there is no catalyst, no dividend or earnings growth it is probably not worth buying. </p> <b>What is a &#x201c;don&#x2019;t&#x201d; when it comes to investing in sideways markets? </b> <br>We need to shield ourselves from the outside world. I am not advocating moving into a cave with no electricity. But we should not allow the outside into our lives unchecked. If we do, the market will become our master, dictating what we do &#x2013; which is the opposite of what we should be doing. I actively try to isolate myself from influences of the market. I found the most productive time I have is on airplanes, because I can write and think for hours; there is little interference by the outside world. I really try hard to only check the prices of my stocks a few times a day. I have not perfected this yet &#x2014; we all have bad habits that it takes time to break. But if we are aware of the negative influences the outside world can have on us, there may be hope for changing our behavior. <p>I usually try to read newspapers and otherwise keep up with the news before I get to the office. Then I try (this is still an effort) to turn off the Wi-Fi switch on my laptop &#x2014; this kills the internet, including email, Skype, IM, and RSS feeds. I try to recreate a plane-like environment at work. I don&#x2019;t turn on the TV during the day. And when I do tune back in, I try to listen to more podcasts, and watch PBS more and business TV less. So to answer your question, I think we should create an environment where the outside world doesn&#x2019;t change (shrink) our time horizon. </p></p><p><p>With the stock market turning into a roller-coaster ride of all-time highs and stomach-churning lows, where does that leave your portfolio?

Thomas L. Pangle argues that the Founders had a dramatically new vision of civic virtue, religious faith, and intellectual life, rooted in an unprecedented commitment to private and economic liberties. It is in the thought of John Locke that Pangle finds the fullest elaboration of the principles supporting the Founders' moral vision.<br> <br> "A work of extraordinary ambition, written with great intensity. . . . [Pangle offers] a trenchant analysis of Locke's writings, designed to demonstrate their remarkable originality and to clarify by doing so as much as the objective predicament as the conscious intentions of the Founding Fathers themselves."&#x2014;John Dunn, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br> <br> "A forcefully argued study of the Founding Fathers' debt to Locke. . . . What distinguishes Pangle's study from the dozens of books which have challenged or elaborated upon the republican revision is the sharpness with which he exposes the errors of the revisionists while at the same time leaving something of substantive value for the reader to consider."&#x2014;Joyce Appleby, <i>Canadian Journal of History</i><br> <br> "Breathtaking in its daring and novelty. . . .

An atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; a hint of that most terrible conception of the human brain&#x2014;a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space.&#x201d;&#x2014;H. P. Lovecraft</p><p><b>Ambrose Bierce</b> (1842&#x2013;1914) was born in Ohio and served in the Civil War. A lifelong journalist, he disappeared mysteriously in Mexico in 1913 while on his way to meet Pancho Villa&#x2019;s army. Among his works are two collections of stories, <i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i> and <i>Can Such Things Be?</i>, and a brilliant satire, <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Dictionary</i>.<br><br><b>Algernon Blackwood</b> (1869&#x2013;1951) was born into an upper-class British family. He emigrated to America at the age of twenty and stayed there some ten years, during which time he worked as a reporter for <i>The New York Evening Sun </i>and <i>The New York Times</i>. When he returned to England he turned to writing fiction and soon made a name for himself with the John Silence stories, which relate the exploits of a psychic detective. Blackwood became famous in later years for playing &#x201c;the Ghost Man&#x201d; on BBC radio.<br><br><b>R.W. Chambers</b> (1865&#x2013;1933) was born in Brooklyn and studied at the Art Students League and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, exhibiting in the Salon in 1889. He sold illustrations to fashion magazines in New York City before taking up writing and finding success with his collection of stories <i>The King in Yellow</i>, which includes &#x201c;The Repairer of Reputations.&#x201d; In later life Chambers published a number of highly successful popular novels, including <i>The Restless Sex </i>and<i> Police!!!</i>, the proceeds from which allowed him to settle in a mansion in upstate New York, where he devoted himself to hunting and fishing.<br><br><b>Walter de la Mare</b> (1876&#x2013;1956) was one of seven children of an official at the Bank of England. He did not attend university, but worked as a bookkeeper for an oil company for some eighteen years, in the course of which he published the poems and stories that secured his literary reputation. In 1908 a grant from the Civil List allowed him to write full time. De la Mare&#x2019;s fiction includes the novels <i>The Return </i>and <i>The Memoirs of a Midget</i>, as well as many stories. His poems for children and adults and his brilliantly inventive anthologies were much admired by T.S. Eliot, who became his publisher, and by W.H. Auden.<br><br><b>Henry James </b>(1843&#x2013;1916) was born in New York City. His father was a distinguished theologian and a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg; his older brother William James became one of America&#x2019;s finest philosophers. James attended Harvard Law School and, with the encouragement of William Dean Howells, took to writing criticism and fiction. After 1866 he lived largely in Europe. His many works include the novels<i> A Portrait of a Lady</i>, <i>The Wings of the Dove</i>, <i>The Ambassadors</i>, and <i>The Golden Bowl</i>, as well as many short stories.<br><b><br>H.P. Lovecraft </b>(1890&#x2013;1937) was born and died in Providence, Rhode Island. His father died of syphilis when he was eight years old; his mother was later institutionalized for mental illness; and Lovecraft himself was a sickly child.&nbsp; In 1913 he joined the United Amateur Press Association, beginning a career as a writer in the course of which he published poems, journalism, and stories. Increasingly drawn to horror fiction, Lovecraft was a regular contributor to the Chicago pulp magazine <i>Weird Tales</i>. His first book-length collection of stories, <i>The Outsider</i>, did not appear until 1939, two years after his death.<br><b><br>Arthur Machen</b> (1863&#x2013;1947) was born in Wales. After failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Surgeons, he worked, not very successfully, as a journalist and translator (most famously of Casanova&#x2019;s memoirs). A friend of the mystic A.E. Waite and a member of the Order of Golden Dawn,&nbsp; Machen was deeply interested in the occult. His fiction includes <i>The Great God Pan</i>, <i>The Three Impostors</i>, and <i>The Hill of Dreams</i>. <br><b><br>Edgar Allan Poe</b> (1809&#x2013;1849) was the son of two traveling actors. Born in Boston, he was orphaned early and adopted by a tobacco exporter in Richmond, Virginia. Poe attended the University of Virginia, which he left because of gambling debts, and West Point, from which he was dishonorably discharged. &#x201c;MS. Found in a Bottle&#x201d; was Poe&#x2019;s first significant success, and it helped him to obtain an editorial position on <i>The Southern Literary Messenger</i> in Baltimore, though he was soon fired for drinking. Poe married his thirteen-year-old cousin, Virginia, and moved north, where he lived in New York City and Philadelphia while continuing to produce poems, criticism, and stories at a prodigious rate. After his wife&#x2019;s death from tuberculosis, Poe&#x2019;s behavior became increasingly erratic. In 1849 he was found drunk and delirious in a bar in Baltimore, the apparent victim of a political gang that had kept him inebriated while escorting him from ballot station to ballot station to cast repeat votes. He died four days later. <br><b><br>M.P. Shiel</b> (1865&#x2013;1947) was born in the West Indies, the son of a Methodist minister of Irish and African descent.

Until now, <em>The Iliad </em>was hijacked by academics and used to bludgeon schoolchildren as a boring-yet- mandatory reading.</p><p>Poet, novelist, essayist, and former teacher John Dolan revisits this ancient tale and restores it to its ancient glory. The Greeks and Trojans are still fighting. The gods are still interfering. But in Dolan's version, you'll be amazed at how funny, raw, and terrifying this doomed world of war really is. He strips away clunky, archaic language to reveal the true meaning and themes that animate this tale of war and futility.</p><p>John Dolan's work under the nom de guerre "Gary Brecher The War Nerd" has been met with both acclaim and controversy. Dolan's version of <em>The Iliad </em>is sapped of the usual saccharine romance attributed to "heroes" and lets the action tell the story. Regardless of attributed name, Dolan/Brecher is an astute observer of modern warfare who now turns that keen analysis to the most classical of documented battles, <em>The Iliad</em>.</p><p><strong>John Dolan </strong>now works with Mark Ames (of eXile fame) to produce the Radio War Nerd weekly podcast on military matters.

UP.</p><p><i>Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes</i>, by Eamon Duffy, is a wonder of comprehensive compression--a sumptuously illustrated, one-volume history of one of the most influential human institutions in world history. Duffy's lively portraits of the 261 scholars, scoundrels, and spiritual guides who have led the Roman Catholic Church are embedded in six historical essays that proceed chronologically from St. Peter to John Paul II. Duffy, a reader in church history and fellow at Cambridge, writes in the mannered yet affable tone of an avuncular English don. His narrative and arguments convey his own Catholic conviction that "the story of the popes is a crucial dimension of the providential care of God for humankind throughout history." Yet he also offers candid assessments of papal moral failings, including spectacular failures such as the orchestration of the Spanish Inquisition and the willed ignorance of Germany's Third Reich. Duffy's glossary of theological terms ensures that no secular reader will be lost in Christian arcana, and his excellent bibliographical essay will help motivated students zero in on the best resources for learning more about any period of Catholic history. For readers primarily concerned with current events, his analysis of John Paul II's papacy is extraordinarily useful and refreshingly free of cant. "To many people Pope John Paul seems a backward-looking figure, a man attempting to force a champagne cork back into the bottle," Duffy writes. "To others, he points the way towards a recovery of balance, a restoration of order and true faith in the flux of time. Only time, and the next conclave, will reveal which of these directions in their long walk through history the heirs of St. Peter will take." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Praise for the earlier edition: "[A] minor masterpiece which is everything good, popular history ought to be. . . . The most comprehensive single-volume history of the popes in print."&#x2014;John Adamson, Sunday Telegraph "The best one-volume history of the papacy ever written."&#x2014;T. F. X. Noble "Duffy enlivens the long march through church history with anecdotes that bring the different pontiffs to life. . . . Saints and Sinners is a remarkable achievement."&#x2014;Piers Paul Read, The Times (London) "A distinguished text . . . offering plenty of historical facts and sobering, valuable judgments."&#x2014;Henry Chadwick, New York Times Book Review "Will intrigue the faithful as well as the skeptical."&#x2014;Economist "A wonderful history of the popes . . . a book that will fascinate anyone wishing to better understand the history of the Catholic Church and the forces that have shaped the role of the papacy."&#x2014;Gloria J. Tysl, Christian Century Inside pages "Duffy's sprightly and sometimes anecdotal style moves the reader effortlessly through the centuries, highlighting popes whose tenure changed the shape of the papacy."&#x2014;Donald L. Gelpi, America "[A] fine survey of the papacy."&#x2014;Gary Wills, New York Review of Books "A grand and critical overview of an institution which Duffy believes has been 'on balance a force for human freedom and largeness of spirit'."&#x2014;Patrick Collins, Times Literary Supplement "This new book offers the most comprehensive one-volume history in English of the popes from ancient times to the pontificate of John Paul II. . . [Duffy's] account is judicious and fair throughout."&#x2014;Robert Louis Wilken, Commonweal "A compelling introduction to one of the most durable and significant institutions to influence the course of Western civilizations."&#x2014;Booklist "An outstanding work."&#x2014;Peter Stanford, The Daily Telegraph "This is as fair-minded, as full and as interesting a survey as a one-volume history of the papacy can be expected to be. Clear, elegant and lively, the book is very readable. It is a stunning achievement, to be grateful for."&#x2014;R.A. Markus, The Tablet "An excellent college-level reference."&#x2014;The Bookwatch "Lively and informative read. . . Duffy peoples his story with real men, and casts interesting, sometimes poignant light on their lives."&#x2014;Jerry Bartram, Globe and Mail "The history of the papacy is a fascinating study whether you consider it theologically, politically, or economically. Duffy offers a masterful blending of all three in this beautiful book."&#x2014;Catholic News Service "The story has all the ingredients of a best-seller. Love, lust, nail-biting struggles for power, a passion for goodness, sometimes an almost equal appetite for evil."&#x2014;Mario Basini, The Western Mail "A wonderful study of heroism and flawed humanity."&#x2014;John Morrill, Catholic Herald "The narrative is full of charming vignettes. . . deserves to be sipped like good wine."&#x2014;Thomas Shelley, Church</p><h2>Mathematics: An Applied Approach</h2><p>Looking for a textbook to help you motivate your students?

Some important changes should be noted:</p><p> </p><p>The sections on the history of vibration, harmonic motion and harmonic analysis are expanded in Chapter 1. </p><p>In Chapter 3 the section on self-excitation and stability analysis has been rewritten and expanded. </p><p>A section on earthquake response spectra has been added to Chapter 4. </p><p>Two new sections, Using Newton's Second Law to Drive Equations of Motion and Free Vibration of Undamped Systems, have been added to Chapter 6. </p><p>A section on forced vibration of beams has been added to Chapter 8. </p><p>The sections on isolation and absorbers have been expanded in Chapter 9. </p><p>The section on experimental modal analysis has been rewritten and a new section on machine condition monitoring and diagnosis has been added to Chapter 10. </p><p>A section on chaos has been added to Chapter 13. </p><p>A section on response of a multidegree of freedom system has been added to Chapter 14. </p><p>Two new appendixes, on mathematical relationships and deflection of beams and plates, are now included. </p><p>Approximately 30 new illustrative examples appear throughout the book. </p><p>More than 220 new problems have been added at the ends of various chapters. </p><p>In several chapters, more project type problems are now included. Features </p><p>Each topic in Mechanical Vibrations is self-contained, with all concepts explained fully and the derivations presented with complete details. The computational aspects are emphasized throughout the book. Several Fortran computer programs, most of them in the form of general purpose subroutines, are included in the diskette accompanying the book. These programs are given for use by the students. Although the programs have been tested, no warranty is implied as to their accuracy. Problems that are based on the use/development of computer programs are given at the end of each chapter and expose students to many important computational and programming details. </p><p>Certain subjects are presented in a somewhat unconventional manner. The topics of Chapters 9, 10, and 11 fall in this category. Most textbooks discuss isolators, absorbers, and balancing in different places. Since one of the main purposes of the study of vibrations is to control vibration response, all topics directly related to vibration control are given in Chapter 9. The vibration-measuring instruments, along with vibration exciters, experimental modal analysis procedures, and machine condition monitoring, are presented in Chapter 10. Similarly, all the numerical integration methods applicable to single- and multi-degree of freedom systems, as well as continuous systems, are unified in Chapter 11. </p><p>Specific features include the following: </p><p>Nearly 130 Illustrative examples accompanying most topics. </p><p>More than 50 review questions to help students in reviewing and testing their understanding of the text material. </p><p>Approximately 850 problems, with solutions in the instructor's manual. </p><p>More than 30 design project type problems at the ends of various chapters. </p><p>Twenty-three computer programs to aid students in the numerical implementation of the methods discussed in the text. </p><p>Biographical information about scientists and engineers who contributed to the development of the theory of vibrations given on the opening pages of chapters and appendixes. </p><p>A convenient format for all examples: Following the statement of each example, the known information, the quantities to be determined, and the approach to be used are first identified and then the detailed solution is given. Notation and Units </p><p>Both the SI and the English system of units have been used in the examples and problems. A list of symbols, along with the associated units in SI and English systems, is given following the Contents. A brief discussion of SI units as they apply to the field of vibrations is given in Appendix E. Arrows are used over symbols to denote column vectors and square brackets are used to indicate matrices. Contents </p><p>Mechanical Vibrations is organized into 14 chapters and 5 appendixes. The material of the book provides flexible options for different types of vibration courses. For a one-semester senior or duel-level course, Chapters 1 through 5, portions of Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 10, and Chapter 9 may be used. The course can be given a computer orientation by including Chapter 11 in place of Chapter 8. Alternatively, with Chapters 12, 13, and 14, the text has sufficient material for a one-year sequence at the senior level. For shorter courses, the instructor can select the topics, depending on the level and orientation of the course. The relative simplicity with which topics are presented also makes the book useful to practicing engineers for purposes of self-study and as a source of references and computer programs. </p><p>Chapter 1 starts with a brief discussion of the history and importance of vibrations. The basic concepts and terminology used in vibration analysis are introduced. The free vibration analysis of single degree of freedom undamped translational and torsional systems is given in Chapter 2. The effects of viscous, Coulomb, and hysteretic damping are also discussed. The harmonic response of single degree of freedom systems is considered in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 is concerned with the response of a single degree of freedom system under general forcing functions. The roles of convolution integral, Laplace transformation, and numerical methods are discussed. The concept of response spectrum is also introduced in this chapter. The free and forced vibration of two degree of freedom systems is considered in Chapter 5. The self-excited vibration and stability of the system are discussed. Chapter 6 presents the vibration analysis of multi-degree of freedom systems. Matrix methods of analysis are used for the presentation of the theory. The modal analysis procedure is described for the solution of forced vibration problems. Several methods of determining the natural frequencies of discrete systems are outlined in Chapter 7. The methods of Dunkerley, Rayleigh, Holzer, and Jacobi and matrix iteration are also discussed. The vibration analysis of continuous systems, including strings, bars, shafts, beams, and membranes is given in Chapter 8. The Rayleigh and Rayleigh-Ritz methods of finding the approximate natural frequencies are also described. Chapter 9 discusses the various aspects of vibration control, including the problems of elimination, isolation, and absorption. The balancing of rotting and reciprocating machines and the whirling of shafts are also considered. The vibration-measuring instruments, vibration exciters, and signal analysis are the topics of Chapter 10. Chapter 11 presents several numerical integration techniques for finding the dynamic response of discrete and continuous systems. The central difference, Runge-Kutta, Houbolt, Wilson, and Newmark methods are summarized and illustrated. Finite element analysis, with applications involving one-dimensional elements, is discussed in Chapter 12. An introductory treatment of nonlinear vibration, including a discussion of subharmonic and superharmonic oscillations, limit cycles, systems with time-dependent coefficients and chaos, is given in Chapter 13. The random vibration of linear vibration systems is considered in Chapter 14. Appendixes A and B focus on mathematical relationships and deflection of beams and plates, respectively. Finally, the basic relations of matrices, Laplace transforms, and SI units are outlined, respectively, in Appendixes C, D, and E.

Byers traces the life of this native Bolivian who early on showed mechanical aptitude and an ability to absorb advanced mathematics and physics. He overcame economic and political obstacles to become a high-school instructor in La Paz, but started again at ground zero when he immigrated to the U.S. in 1963. The sheer determination, discipline, and hard work he displayed in establishing his career are the same qualities he has always demanded from his students. The 1988 film Stand and Deliver brought Escalante's methods and accomplishments with inner-city youth from Los Angeles into the national spotlight. Interviews and speeches are among the sources the author draws upon, and humorous examples show Escalante's creativity. Average-quality black-and-white photos present the subject, his family, and pupils. Young people will relate to the many anecdotes in this book that illustrate Escalante's dedication to helping others learn.</p><p><i>Janet Woodward, Franklin High School, Seattle, WA</i></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Clinical Experiences of 70 Years in Homoeopathy</h2><p>This book is a rare masterpiece of the clinical Experiences of the oldest living practitioner and Teacher of Homeopathic Medicine in India.

While a classic in literature and among the most widely read autobiographies in the world, he stopped writing it in 1757-years before the most exciting events of his life. Now, in honor of the 300th anniversary of Franklin&#39;s birth, Skousen has finished the autobiography completely in Franklin&#39;s own words.</p><p>Franklin&#x2014;in Franklin&#x2019;s Own Words Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s celebrated Autobiography, published after his death, is one of the greatest autobiographies of all time... but it was incomplete. Franklin ended his life&#x2019;s story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He planned to write more&#x2014;a lot more, but never did. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America&#x2019;s advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America&#x2019;s wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation&#x2019;s Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire. Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers&#x2014;a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin&#x2019;s own words. Faithfully compiled and edited from Franklin&#x2019;s papers by Dr. Mark Skousen&#x2014; Franklin&#x2019;s descendant, acting as his devoted secretary&#x2014;this is the closest we will ever get to Franklin sitting down in his study in Philadelphia, dipping quill into ink, and finishing his autobiography. In The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, you&#x2019;ll learn: * Why the United States could not have won the war without Franklin&#x2019;s diplomatic heroics<p> * What Franklin really thought of his fellow patriots, like Adams, Jefferson, and Washington</p><p> * Franklin&#x2019;s dramatic one-word change in the Declaration of Independence * Franklin&#x2019;s radical views on the Constitution, and how his compromise cleared a critical roadblock at the Convention</p><p> * Franklin&#x2019;s candid views on sex and adultery while in France</p><p> * His personal philosophy as a radical democrat, and sometimes a social conservative</p><p> * How the American Revolution caused Franklin to shift from a free-thinking heretic to a pragmatic believer Soon to be a classic of American history, the Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin is beautifully illustrated and designed&#x2014;and a must-read, as we celebrate the 300th anniversary of Franklin&#x2019;s birth. On each page, the reader will discover what it truly means to be an American, what a precious heritage has been bequeathed to us, and how great the United States has been from the beginning, all seen through the eyes of the most colorful of the Founding Fathers.</p>Benjamin Fraklin, considered the grandfather of America, is Mark Skousen&#x2019;s eighth-generation grandfather, through Franklin&#x2019;s grandson Louis Bache. He has had a lifelong interest in the "grandfather" of our nation. Dr. Skousen&#x2019;s career has sometimes followed that of his illustrious ancestor, as a publisher, author, financial advisor, teacher, father, public servant, and world traveler. He is also the author of The Wit and Wisdom of Benjamin Franklin.</p><h2>The Divine Spark: A Graham Hancock Reader: Psychedelics, Consciousness, and the Birth of Civilization</h2><p><p>Psychedelics: Medicinal?

Draws on contrasts with other industrialized countries and extensive comparisons within the US at the state and city level to promote understanding of how factors such as American values, political structure, and the split between the Socialist Party and mainstream unions combined to seal socialism&#39;s fate. Lipset teaches public policy at George Mason University; Marks is professor of political science and founding director of the Center for European Studies at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Seymour Martin Lipset is the Hazel Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University and a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Gary Marks is professor of political science and director of the Center for European Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.Marx decreed in Capital that the most industrially advanced nation would usher the world into the bright dawn of socialism. But it didn't happen in America, the pinnacle of capitalist achievement. This broad but unambitious survey addresses one of the classic questions of American historiography: What accounts for the weakness of working-class radicalism in the U.S.? Preferring to restate the highlights of an admittedly worked-over literature on the subject rather than make significant new arguments of their own, Lipset (professor of public policy at George Mason University) and Marks (political science at UNC-Chapel Hill) present a "political sociology" of socialism's American flop. Lacking the feudal history that spurred Europe's early labor movements, the authors explain, American workers were "born conservatives," already enjoying social mobility and a relative prosperity. Moreover, strong constitutional limits on government power thwarted collectivists from the get-go and led homegrown radicals toward libertarian or anarchist camps. America's invincible two-party system made it all but impossible for a socialist candidate to succeed; since the Civil War, the authors point out, just nine non-major party candidates have won more than 5% of the national vote in any presidential election. What surprises there are in this book pop up in little-known annals of U.S. radicalism, such as the North Dakota Nonpartisan League, a strikingly successful contingent that in 1919 proposed a system of state ownership, only to be bitterly attacked by America's socialist party as an opportunistic rival. Green parties, the authors say, are the latest venue for utopian reform desires; again, the U.S. remains exceptional, as they point out, with no influential environmental party.

Over years of groundbreaking experiments, he has distilled remarkable discoveries significant enough to become the bedrock of a whole new scientific field: social physics. Humans have more in common with bees than we like to admit: We&#x2019;re social creatures first and foremost. Our most important habits of action&#x2014;and most basic notions of common sense&#x2014;are wired into us through our coordination in social groups. Social physics is about <i>idea flow</i>, the way human social networks spread ideas and transform those ideas into behaviors.<br><br> Thanks to the millions of digital bread crumbs people leave behind via smartphones, GPS devices, and the Internet, the amount of new information we have about human activity is truly profound. Until now, sociologists have depended on limited data sets and surveys that tell us how people <i>say</i> they think and behave, rather than what they actually <i>do</i>. As a result, we&#x2019;ve been stuck with the same stale social structures&#x2014;classes, markets&#x2014;and a focus on individual actors, data snapshots, and steady states. Pentland shows that, in fact, humans respond much more powerfully to social incentives that involve rewarding others and strengthening the ties that bind than incentives that involve only their own economic self-interest.<br><br> Pentland and his teams have found that they can study <i>patterns </i>of information exchange in a social network without any knowledge of the actual <i>content </i>of the information and predict with stunning accuracy how productive and effective that network is, whether it&#x2019;s a business or an entire city. We can maximize a group&#x2019;s collective intelligence to improve performance and use social incentives to create new organizations and guide them through disruptive change in a way that maximizes the good. At every level of interaction, from small groups to large cities, social networks can be tuned to increase exploration and engagement, thus vastly improving idea flow.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Social Physics</i> will change the way we think about how we learn and how our social groups work&#x2014;and can be made to work better, at every level of society. Pentland leads readers to the edge of the most important revolution in the study of social behavior in a generation, an entirely new way to look at life itself.</p><p>Alex "Sandy" Pentland directs MIT&#x2019;s Human Dynamics Laboratory and the MIT Media Lab Entrepreneurship Program and co-leads the World Economic Forum Big Data and Personal Data initiatives. He helped create and direct MIT&#x2019;s Media Laboratory, the Media Lab Asia laboratories at the Indian Institutes of Technology, and Strong Hospital&#x2019;s Center for Future Health. His research group and entrepreneurship program have spun off more than thirty companies to date. In 2012 <i>Forbes </i>named Pentland one of the seven most powerful data scientists in the world. His research has been featured in <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i>, and <i>Harvard Business Review</i>.<b><i>The Economist</i>:</b><br>&#x201c;<i>Social Physics</i> is filled with rich findings about what makes people tick. Using millions of data points measured over a long period of time in real settings, which Pentland calls &#x2018;living laboratories,&#x2019; the author has monitored human behavior on an unprecedented scale...Pentland&#x2019;s research also offers lessons for policymakers and business people. He advances a new way to protect privacy by creating something of a property right for personal information...<i>Social Physics</i> is a fascinating look at a new field by one of its principal geeks.&#x201d;<br><br><b>John Abele, Co-Founder, Boston Scientific:</b><br>&#x201c;Understanding, predicting and influencing human behavior has been the goal of social scientists (and leaders anywhere) since the beginning of time. Pentland&#x2019;s <i>Social Physics</i> is a major contribution to this field. By using communication tracking analysis and occasionally human sensors along with big data, he and his team are evolving a new discipline with a unique taxonomy and ontology that brings a higher level of quantification and rigor to a challenging and inherently complex field. Like Surowiecki&#x2019;s <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i> it will spawn further work and research in a rapidly expanding new body of knowledge.&#x201d;<br><br><b>John Seely Brown, Former Chief Scientist, Xerox Corporation and director of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC):</b><br>&#x201c;Read this book and you will look at tomorrow differently. Reality mining is just the first step on an exciting new journey. <i>Social Physics</i> opens up the imagination to what might now be measurable and modifiable. It also hints at what may lie beyond Adam Smith&#x2019;s invisible hand in helping groups, organizations and societies reach new levels of meaning creation. This is not just social analytics. It also offers pragmatic ways forward.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Reed E. Hundt, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, CEO of the Coalition for Green Capital:</b><br>&#x201c;From his MIT aerie, eagle-eyed Alex Pentland has seen the future. His wise and stimulating book teaches us how ideas spring up, flow, and spread. Applying his lessons, we can act collectively to solve previously intractable social, economic and political problems. We can make organizations more productive. We can even have government achieve its proper purposes, with greater fairness and less cost. As challenges like widening inequality and runaway climate change seem to exceed our ability to design solutions, Pentland&#x2019;s data-driven, reality-based, yet sunny optimism about tomorrow should be eagerly welcomed by all readers.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Stephen M. Kosslyn, Former Dean of Social Science, Harvard University; Former Director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University; Founding Dean, Minerva Schools at KGI</b><b>:</b><br>&#x201c;Sandy Pentland lives in the future&#x2014;and it shows. This book will not only whisk you up to speed on cutting-edge research at the interface of technology, behavioral science, and the social world, but it will also give you a good sense of what could be next. Professor Pentland brilliantly analyzes how new ideas flow and how, with the emergence of the &#x2018;data-driven society,&#x2019; they will increasingly influence every aspect of our lives.&#x201d;</p><h2>Clinical Kinesiology and Anatomy (Clinical Kinesiology for Physical Therapist Assistants)</h2><p><p>The 5th Edition of this classic kinesiology text continues the tradition of presenting a very complicated topic in a clear, simple, and easy-to-understand manner.

He is the author of three other novels, including, most recently, Only Say the Word.A remarkable first novel from Williams--whose four previous books, written with his wife, have chronicled contemporary Irish life (The Luck of the Irish, 1995, etc.)--offers a powerful portrait of tragedy and of the redemption offered by love. Nicholas was a normal Dublin 12-year-old when his civil- servant father came home to announce he'd forsaken his career to become a painter. The full implications of that decision became clear shortly thereafter: Abandoning wife and son, the artist went off to the Irish countryside for the summer. After two summers of this and no income, Nicholas's mother committed suicide. Father and son struggled on, making one memorable painting trip to the western coast, after which cows destroyed many of the paintings, leaving the artist in doubt of his vocation. Years pass. Nicholas's own civil service career is cut short when his father burns his paintings, their house, and himself. Only one painting remains, a work that had been purchased and given as an award to a poet living on one of the western isles, and Nicholas goes to see whether he can buy it back. The poet's family is also familiar with despair: The only son, a musical prodigy, suffered a seizure one day while playing for his dancing sister, Isabel, and for years has been unable to play or speak. Isabel, blaming herself for his affliction, grew wild in her mainland convent school and threw away a good chance at a university education to marry a coarse, unprosperous tweed merchant whom she doesn't love. Nicholas arrives on the scene the day after Isabel's wedding, and his presence magically, inexplicably, begins to cause a shift in the prevailing winds of fortune. While a wealth of impressions linger from this debut, two words come most often to mind in describing it: Spellbinding. Brilliant. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Shoulders rounded down, head cocked to the right, nose an inch from the tip of his pen. Absorbed. My heart swells with a painful sort of euphoria. He&#x2019;s close, only two tables over and facing my direction. The caf� is boiling. The atmosphere is clouded with bittersweet coffee. Three years of desire rip through my body and burst from my lips:</p><p>&#x201c;Josh!&#x201d;</p><p>His head jolts up. For a long time, a very long time, he just stares at me. And then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he blinks. &#x201c;Isla?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know my name. You can <i>pronounce</i> my name.&#x201d; Most people call me Iz-la, but I&#x2019;m Eye-la. Island without the <i>nd</i>. I erupt into a smile that immediately vanishes. <i>Ouch.</i></p><p>Josh glances around, as if searching for someone, and then cautiously sets down his pen. &#x201c;Uh, yeah. We&#x2019;ve sat beside each other in a ton of classes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Five classes beside each other, twelve classes together total.&#x201d;</p><p>A pause.</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he says slowly. Another pause. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>A guy who looks like a young Abraham Lincoln with a piercing fetish tosses a single-page laminated menu onto my table.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t look at it. &#x201c;Something soft, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Abe scratches his beard, weary.</p><p>&#x201c;But no tomato soup, chocolate pudding, or raspberry applesauce. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve had to eat today,&#x201d; I add.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Abe&#x2019;s mood lightens. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>His mood darkens again. &#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d; He snatches up the menu. &#x201c;Allergic to anything? You kosher? Vegetarian?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a look in the kitchen.&#x201d; And he stalks away.</p><p>My gaze returns to Josh, who is still watching me. He looks down at his sketchbook, and then back up, and then back down. Like he can&#x2019;t decide if we&#x2019;re still having a conversation. I look down, too. I&#x2019;m getting the increasingly alarming notion that if I keep talking, tomorrow I might have something to regret.</p><p>But.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as if I can&#x2019;t help it&#x2014;because I <i>can&#x2019;t,</i> not when I&#x2019;m around him&#x2014;I glance up. My veins throb as my eyes drink him in. His long, beautiful nose. His slender, assured arms. His pale skin is a few shades darker from the summer sun, and his black tattoo peeks out from underneath his T-shirt sleeve.</p><p>Joshua Wasserstein. My crush on him is near unbearable.</p><p>He looks up again, too, and I blush. Blushing. The curse of redheads everywhere. I&#x2019;m grateful when he clears his throat to speak. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s strange, you know? That we&#x2019;ve never run into each other before.&#x201d;</p><p>I leap in. &#x201c;Do you come here often?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; He fidgets with his pen. &#x201c;I meant in the city? I knew you lived on the Upper West, but I&#x2019;ve never seen you around.&#x201d;</p><p>My chest tightens. I knew that about him, but I had no idea that <i>he</i> knew that about <i>me.</i> We attend a boarding school for Americans in Paris, but we spend our breaks in Manhattan. Everybody knows that Josh lives here, because his father has one of the New York seats in the United States Senate. But there&#x2019;s no reason for anyone to remember that I live here, too.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get out often,&#x201d; I blurt. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m starving, and there&#x2019;s nothing to eat at home.&#x201d; And then, somehow, I&#x2019;m dropping into the empty seat across from him. My compass necklace knocks against his tabletop. &#x201c;My wisdom teeth were removed this morning, and I&#x2019;m taking all of these medications, but my mouth is still sore so that&#x2019;s why I can only eat soft foods.&#x201d;</p><p>Josh breaks into his first smile.</p><p>Accomplishment puffs up inside of me. I return the smile as full as I can, even though it hurts. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Painkillers. It makes sense now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, shit.&#x201d; I tuck up a leg and smack my kneecap on the table. &#x201c;Am I acting that loopy?&#x201d;</p><p>He laughs with surprise. People always laugh, because they don&#x2019;t expect words like <i>shit</i> to come out of someone so petite, someone with a voice so quiet, so sweet. &#x201c;I could just tell something was different,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Side effects include the cruel combination of exhaustion and insomnia. Which is why I&#x2019;m here now.&#x201d;</p><p>Josh laughs again. &#x201c;I had mine extracted last summer. You&#x2019;ll feel better tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Promise?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really. But definitely in a few days.&#x201d;</p><p>Our smiles fade into a reflective silence. We&#x2019;ve rarely spoken to each other at school and never outside of it. I&#x2019;m too shy, and he&#x2019;s too reserved. Plus, he had the same girlfriend for, like, forever.</p><p><i>Had.</i></p><p>They broke up last month, right before her graduation. Josh and I still have our senior year to go. And I wish there were a logical reason for him to show a sudden interest in me, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there&#x2019;s not. His ex was tenacious and outspoken. My opposite. Maybe that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m startled when I find myself pointing at his sketchbook, eager to prolong this temporary state. This miracle of conversation.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you working on?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>His arm shifts to block the exposed drawing, someone resembling a young Abe Lincoln. &#x201c;I was just.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. messing around.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our server.&#x201d; I grin. <i>Ouch.</i></p><p>He looks a bit sheepish as he pulls back his arm, but he only shrugs. &#x201c;And the couple in the corner.&#x201d;</p><p>We&#x2019;re not alone?</p><p>I twist around to discover a middle-aged man and woman, all the way in the back, sharing a copy of the<i> Village Voice.</i> There isn&#x2019;t anyone else here, so at least I&#x2019;m not too out of it. I don&#x2019;t think. I turn back to Josh, my courage rising.</p><p>&#x201c;May I see that?&#x201d;</p><p>I asked. I can&#x2019;t <i>believe</i> that I asked. I&#x2019;ve always wanted to look inside of his sketchbooks, always wanted to <i>hold</i> one. Josh is the most talented artist at our school. He works in several mediums, but his real passion is the comic form. I once overheard him say that he&#x2019;s working on a graphic novel about his life.</p><p>An autobiography. A diary. What secrets would it contain?</p><p>I content myself with doodles viewed over his shoulder, paintings drying in the art studio, sketches tacked to the doors of his friends. His style is almost whimsical. It&#x2019;s melancholy and beautiful, completely his own. The lines are careful. They reveal that he pays attention. People don&#x2019;t think he does, because he daydreams and skips class and neglects his homework, but when I see his drawings, I know they&#x2019;re wrong.</p><p>I wish he would look at me the way that he looks at his subjects. Because then he&#x2019;d see there&#x2019;s more to me than <i>shy</i>,<i> </i>just like I see there&#x2019;s more to him than <i>slacker.</i></p><p>My cheeks burn again&#x2014;as if he could hear my thoughts&#x2014;but then I realize.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he <i>is</i> studying me. Have I overstayed my welcome? His expression grows concerned, and I frown. Josh nods toward the table. His sketchbook is already before me.</p><p>I laugh. He does, too, though it&#x2019;s tinged with confusion.</p><p>His book is still open to the work in progress. A thrill runs through me. On one page, Abe&#x2019;s face stares with boredom at the sketchbook&#x2019;s spine. Even the rings in his septum, eyebrows, and ears seem dull and annoyed. On the opposite page, Josh has perfectly captured the middle-aged couple&#x2019;s studious, gentle frowns.</p><p>I touch a corner, one without ink, oh so lightly. To prove to myself that this moment is real. My voice turns reverent. &#x201c;These are amazing. Is the whole thing filled with portraits like this?&#x201d;</p><p>Josh closes the sketchbook and slides it back toward himself. Its pages are thick with use. On the cover is a blue sticker shaped like America. A single word has been handwritten across it: <i>WELCOME</i>. I don&#x2019;t know what that means, but I like it.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; He gives me another smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for whatever, but yeah. Mainly portraits.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re allowed to do that?&#x201d;</p><p>His brow creases. &#x201c;Do what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like, you don&#x2019;t need their permission?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To draw them?&#x201d; he asks. I nod, and he continues. &#x201c;Nah. I&#x2019;m not using these for anything special. This isn&#x2019;t even my good sketchbook. See? I can&#x2019;t remove the pages.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you do this a lot? Draw strangers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; He reaches for his coffee cup with an index finger. There&#x2019;s a splotch of black ink near his nail. &#x201c;To be good at anything you have to practice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you wanna practice on me?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>Pink blossoms across Josh&#x2019;s cheeks as Abe slaps down two dishes. &#x201c;Chicken broth and cheesecake,&#x201d; Abe says to me. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all we had.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Merci,&#x201d;</i> I say.</p><p><i>&#x201c;De nada.&#x201d;</i> Abe rolls his eyes and walks away.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with that guy?&#x201d; I ask, shoveling in the cheesecake. &#x201c;Ohmygod, sogood.&#x201d; I mumble this through a full mouth. &#x201c;Youwannabite?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh. No, thanks.&#x201d; Josh seems flustered. &#x201c;You look hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>I begin happily devouring the rest.</p><p>&#x201c;So you live close by?&#x201d; he asks, after a few moments.</p><p>I swallow. &#x201c;Two minutes away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me too. Ten minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>I must look surprised, because he continues. &#x201c;I know. Weird, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s cool.&#x201d; I glug my broth. &#x201c;Ohmygod. This is incredible.&#x201d;</p><p>He watches me quietly for another minute. &#x201c;So.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you were serious? You wouldn&#x2019;t mind if I sketched you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;d love that.&#x201d; <i>I love youuuuuuuuu. </i>&#x201c;What should I do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. Just keep doing what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha! You&#x2019;ll draw me eating like a horse. No. A pig. I meant pig. Do I mean a pig or a horse?&#x201d;</p><p>Josh shakes his head in amusement. He opens the sketchbook to a new page and looks up. His eyes lock on to mine. I&#x2019;m dumbstruck.</p><p><i>Hazel.</i></p><p>The word adds itself to my internal list of Facts About Josh. Sometimes his eyes had seemed green, sometimes brown. Now I know why.</p><p><i>Hazel.</i> Josh&#x2019;s eyes are <i>hazel.</i></p><p>I float into a green-brown fog. The <i>scritch</i> of his pen mingles with the <i>scratch</i> of an old folk song coming from the speakers. Their combined tune is yearning and turmoil and anguish and love. Outside, storm clouds burst. Rain and wind join the score, and I hum along. My head clunks against a window.</p><p>I sit up, startled. My bowl and plate are empty. &#x201c;How long have I been here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A while.&#x201d; Josh smiles. &#x201c;So. Those drugs you&#x2019;re on. Good stuff, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>I moan. &#x201c;Tell me I wasn&#x2019;t drooling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No drool. You look happy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I <i>am</i> happy,&#x201d; I say. Because.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am. My eyes dim.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Isla,&#x201d;</i> he whispers. &#x201c;<i>It&#x2019;s time to go.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>I lift my head from the table. When did it get there?</p><p>&#x201c;Kismet is closing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Kismet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fate,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The name of this caf�.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Okay.&#x201d; I follow him outside and into the night. It&#x2019;s still raining. The drops are fat and warm. I cover my head with my bare hands as Josh stuffs his sketchbook underneath his shirt. I catch a glimpse of his abdomen. <i>Yummy.</i> &#x201c;Yummy tummy.&#x201d;</p><p>He startles. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d;</p><p>A smile plays in the corners of his lips. I want to kiss them, one kiss in each corner. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Loopy.&#x201d; He shakes his head. &#x201c;Which way?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which way to what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To your place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re coming over?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m delighted.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m walking you home.

I point the way, and we run across Amsterdam Avenue. The rain pours harder. &#x201c;Up there!&#x201d; I say, and we duck underneath a city block covered in scaffolding. Weighty raindrops clang against the aluminum like a pinball machine.</p><p>&#x201c;Isla, wait!&#x201d;</p><p>But it&#x2019;s too late.</p><p>Scaffolding is generally ideal for escaping bad weather, but occasionally the bars will cross together to create a funnel, which can collect water and soak a person completely. I am soaked. Completely. My hair clings to my face, my sundress clings to my figure, and water squishes between my sandals and the soles of my feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Ha-ha.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s real laughter.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; Josh stoops under the scaffolding, swerves around the waterfall, and then stoops back in beside me.</p><p>I <i>am</i> laughing. I clutch my stomach. &#x201c;Hurts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mouth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to laugh. My mouth. My mouth and my stomach. And my mouth.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughs, too, but it&#x2019;s distracted. His eyes suddenly, pointedly move up to my face, and I realize he&#x2019;d been looking elsewhere. My smile widens. <i>Thank you, slutty funnel.</i></p><p>Josh shifts away, his posture uncomfortable. &#x201c;Almost there, yeah?&#x201d;</p><p>I gesture toward a row of gabled buildings across the street. &#x201c;The second one. With the copper-green windows and the tiled roof.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve sketched those before.&#x201d; His eyes widen, impressed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re gorgeous.&#x201d;</p><p>My parents&#x2019; apartment is located in a line of Flemish-inspired homes built in the late nineteenth century. We live in one of the only neighborhoods that&#x2019;s nice enough for residents to have flowers on their stoops, and passersby won&#x2019;t destroy them.</p><p>&#x201c;Maman likes them, too. She likes pretty things. She&#x2019;s French. That&#x2019;s why I go to our school.&#x201d; My voice drifts as Josh guides me toward the entrance with the climbing pink roses above the door. Home. He removes his hand from the small of my back, and it&#x2019;s only then that I realize it was there in the first place.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Merci,&#x201d;</i> I say.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I say.</p><p><i>&#x201c;De rien.&#x201d;</i></p><p>The air is heavy with the perfume of rain-dripped roses. I fumble my way inside the building, and he waits on the sidewalk, statuesque. His dark hair is as wet as mine now. A stream of water cascades down his nose. One arm clutches the sketchbook against his chest, underneath his T-shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I say again.</p><p>He raises his voice so that I can hear him through the glass door. &#x201c;Get some rest, Loopy.

Stressing a global perspective, it shows that this subject has real importance to understanding the world in which we live today. This comprehensive book also includes a look at career prospects in the field for interested readers. <b> </b> The overall approach is descriptive and explanatory: it describes fundamental principles, the history of the field, and basic definitions; moves through methods and discusses topics such as time and space, historical artifacts, survey, and excavation; and then presents basic archaeological theories and research. <b> </b> For readers interested in historical archaeology, a rapidly expanding field that has been recently conducted on every continent in the world. </p></p><p><p> Archaeology is an odd discipline. Most people have heard of it and think they know what it is, but the same people actually know very little about it. Archaeology is perhaps the most famous and yet least understood academic pursuit in existence! Movies depict us archaeologists either as bold adventurers or as absent-minded scholars digging in the shadow of lofty pyramids. We are seen cutting through dense jungles and poring over clay tablets. We get excited about ancient stone tools and faint drawings on cave walls. These images, though often quite fanciful, are not totally incorrect. Archaeologists do get excited about what we do; we love the past and we want to share our passion for it with all who will listen. Archaeology is an adventure, but it is also a sophisticated discipline that studies the entire spectrum of human history. We archaeologists investigate the full range of human life, from our origins to our modern-day urban landfills. </p> <p> Archaeology, like most of today's complex areas of study, has a number of specializations. None of us can be expected to know everything about the entire sweep of human history. Some of us study ancient ways of life, while others of us concentrate on more recent history. This book explores the archaeology that focuses on modern history in all its fascinating regional, cultural, and ethnic diversity. </p> <p> Historical archaeology, the archaeological study of recent history, has expanded dramatically in recent years. This book provides an introduction to this exciting field by covering its basic methods and concepts. The first three chapters describe fundamental principles, the history of the field, and basic definitions. From there we move to consider the methods of historical archeology, and explore such topics as time and space, historical artifacts, survey, and excavation. I present some basic archaeological theories and discuss some of the archaeological research that is being conducted across the globe. My focus is on the Dutch global empire. I also briefly examine the changing face of historical archaeology, by explaining cultural resource management. We end our trip through historical archaeology with a look at career prospects in the field and at ways students like you can help save the past from senseless destruction. Major references for further study are provided at the end of the book. A glossary is also presented as an easy guide to some of the archaeologists' more technical terms. </p> <p> This second edition has been significantly revised and expanded. I have corrected the mistakes from the first edition and updated many of the examples. I have also expanded the references to include works of importance published since the first edition. One new addition is the inclusion of short vignettes, I call them "time travels," at the end of each chapter. These are entirely based on archeological and historical research conducted by professional historical archaeologists. They are intended to indicate the richness of today's historical archaeology. I have included those sites that I think are interesting or which have something especially enlightening to say. I could easily have chosen thirteen other sites, because the field today is so vast and varied. My hope is that these brief examples will encourage you to explore historical archaeology further. </p> <p> No one book can hope to offer an exhaustive overview of today's historical archaeology. The field is simply expanding far too rapidly for that. My goal, therefore, is to offer this brief volume to give you insights into the fascinating world of historical archaeology. An exciting field of study awaits you and you are very welcome to join us! </p> <p> Charles E.

Marieb</b>, taking the student&#x2019;s perspective into account has always been an integral part of her teaching style. Dr. Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught anatomy and physiology to physical education majors. She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College in 1969 after receiving her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching at Holyoke Community College, where many of her students were pursuing nursing degrees, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of the nursing practice. To that end, while continuing to teach full time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts. It is this experience that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her publications are known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb has partnered with Benjamin Cummings for over 30 years. Her first work was <i>Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology Laboratory Manual</i> (Cat Version), which came out in 1981. In the years since, several other lab manual versions and study guides, as well as the softcover Essentials of Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology textbook, have hit the campus bookstores. This textbook, now in its 10th edition, made its appearance in 1989 and is the latest expression of her commitment to the needs of students studying human anatomy and physiology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb has given generously to colleges both near and far to provide opportunities for students to further their education. She contributes to the New Directions, New Careers Program at Holyoke Community College by funding a staffed drop-in center and by providing several full-tuition scholarships each year for women who are returning to college after a hiatus or attending college for the first time and who would be unable to continue their studies without financial support. She funds the E. N. Marieb Science Research Awards at Mount Holyoke College, which promotes research by undergraduate science majors, and has underwritten renovation and updating of one of the biology labs in Clapp Laboratory at that college. Dr. Marieb also contributes to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where she generously provided funding for reconstruction and instrumentation of a cutting-edge cytology research laboratory. Recognizing the severe national shortage of nursing faculty, she underwrites the Nursing Scholars of the Future Grant Program at the university. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1994, Dr. Marieb received the Benefactor Award from the National Council for Resource Development, American Association of Community Colleges, which recognizes her ongoing sponsorship of student scholarships, faculty teaching awards, and other academic contributions to Holyoke Community College. In May 2000, the science building at Holyoke Community College was named in her honor. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb is an active member of the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Additionally, while actively engaged as an author, Dr. Marieb serves as a consultant for the Benjamin Cummings Interactive Physiology� CD-ROM series. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When not involved in academic pursuits, Dr. Marieb is a world traveler and has vowed to visit every country on this planet. Shorter term, she serves on the scholarship committee of the Women&#x2019;s Resources Center and on the board of directors of several charitable institutions in Sarasota County. She is an enthusiastic supporter of the local arts and enjoys a competitive match of doubles tennis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Lori A. Smith</b> received her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of California at Davis. Before discovering her passion for teaching, she worked as a research scientist and project leader in the medical diagnostics industry. In 1999, she joined the faculty at American River College in the Biology Department.&nbsp; Currently she teaches anatomy and physiology and microbiology to pre-nursing and mortuary science students at American River College. Starting in 2005, she began co-authoring Pearson&#x2019;s <i>PhysioEx: Laboratory Simulations in Physiology</i> and has continued to co-author several versions of the software and lab manual. She is also co-authoring Pearson&#x2019;s <i>Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology</i> Lab Manual. Dr. Smith has been awarded &#x201c;Instructor of the Year&#x201d; by the American River College Associated Students for her commitment to serving students, and she is a member of the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS) and the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT). </p></p><h2>Minimum Design Loads for Buildings And Other Structures: SEI/ASCE 7-05 (ASCE Standard No. 7-05)</h2><p>The new ASCE Standard 7-05 Standard (including Supplement No.1) provides requirements for general structural design and includes means for determining dead, live, soil, flood, wind, snow, rain, atmospheric ice, and earthquake loads, and their combinations that are suitable for inclusion in building codes and other documents. A detailed commentary containing explanatory and supplementary information to assist users of ASCE 7-05 is included. This ASCE 7-05 edition is a complete revision of ASCE 7-02. The new Standard includes revised and significantly reorganized provisions for seismic design of structures, as well as revisions in the provisions for determining live, flood, wind, snow, and atmospheric ice loads. The inclusion of Supplement No. 1 into ASCE 7-05 ensures that there is full and complete coordination between the 2006 International Building Code and ASCE 7-05. The updates which comprised Supplement No. 1 are seamlessly integrated into the 7-05 volume, and are not available anywhere else. ASCE 7-05 is an integral part of the building codes of the United States. The earthquake load provisions in ASCE 7-05 are substantially adopted by reference in the 2006 International Building Code and the 2006 NFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code. Numerous other provisions of all other ASCE 7-05 sections are also adopted by reference by both model building codes including the provisions for calculating wind loads and snow loads. Structural engineers, architects, and those engaged in preparing and administering local building codes will find the structural load requirements essential to their practice.</p><p></p><h2>Starting Out With Visual Basic</h2><p><p>&nbsp;<i>For courses in Visual Basic Programming</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In <b> <i>Starting Out with Visual Basic,</i> </b> Tony Gaddis and Kip Irvine take a step-by-step approach, helping students understand the logic behind developing quality programs while introducing the Visual Basic language.

Recipes from the famous store were featured in <i>The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook</i> by Magnolia owner, Alyssa Torey. In <i>At Home with Magnolia</i>, she provides 90-plus all-course, all-occasion formulas--classic and original--for dishes like Chicken Kiev; Leek, Corn and Mascarpone Tart; and Gemelli with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Artichokes, Arugula, and Yellow Pepper.

With many color photos of the dishes and of the author on her farm (where, presumably, the recipes originated), this is just the sort of collection cooks will find themselves relying on again and again. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>Nearly every day, people line up around the block at Allysa Torey's Magnolia Bakery in New York City. The reason is simple&#x2014;Magnolia is the place to get all-American sweet treats like their famous pastel frosted cupcakes, layer cakes, and icebox desserts. But away from the bakery, at her country home in upstate New York, Allysa cooks a lot more than desserts. Now, at last, she shares more than 90 of her family-friendly recipes for appetizers, soups, lunches, dinners, side dishes, casseroles, vegetables, and of course, desserts&#x2014;and invites you to experience the delights of country living, Allysa Torey&#x2013;style. <p></p><p>Like the signature baked goods that havemade Magnolia so successful, these relaxed dishes are packed with flavor and old-fashioned comfort food appeal. Allysa's recipes are un-fussy, easy to prepare, and brimming with garden-fresh ingredients&#x2014;the perfect dishes for everyday family meals as well as weekend entertaining. More than 70 color photographs capture the appeal of these fresh, simple dishes, as well as Allysa's rural Victorian home and gardens. You'll find yourself immersed in the everyday pleasures of country living&#x2014;the aroma of fresh-baked muffins and pies, the bounty of beautiful farmers' market produce, the enchantment of a candle-lit alfresco buffet.</p><p>Here are new twists on traditional American favorites such as Chicken and Vegetable Stew with Cream Cheese Herb Crust, Sweet Potato Casserole with Almond-Streusel Topping, and Yellow Split Pea Soup with Smoked Ham Hock.

For dinner, there are both quick and flavorful weeknight recipes such as Lemon-Tarragon Chicken and Grilled Salmon with Corn and Cherry Tomato Salad, and more elaborate dishes for entertaining, such as Mustard Herb Pork Loin Roast with Cornbread Apple-Pecan Dressing and Cider Gravy and Potato Gnocchi with Tomato Cream Sauce, Peas, and Mozzarella.</p><p>No Magnolia cookbook would be complete without desserts, and here Allysa servesup two dozen of her favorites. There are cupcakes, of course, as well as lots of other sweet indulgences, including Strawberry Icebox Pie, Cream Cheese Swirl Brownies with Heath Bars and Pecans, Buttermilk Cake with Nectarines and Vanilla Ice Cream, Pineapple Cheesecake with White Chocolate Sauce and Macadamias, and Blueberry Coffeecake with Cinnamon Crumbs.</p><p>Filled with mouthwatering recipes and inspir-ing photographs, At Home with Magnolia is a cookbook that you'll feel instantly at home with as you whip up old-fashioned, fresh-flavored dishes that family and friends will love.</p></p><h2>Fire: A Brief History (Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books)</h2><p>"The fate of humanity, like the fate of the earth, is tied to the fires that have made the world as we know it--the fires whose history is told as well in this book as it has ever been told before. If one wants to understand just how completely the story of the human past is also the story of fire on earth, there is no better place to start than this small book."--William Cronon<p>Here, in one concise book, is the essential story of fire. Noted environmental historian Stephen J. Pyne describes the evolution of fire through prehistoric and historic times down to the present, examining contemporary attitudes from a long-range, informed perspective. <i>Fire: A Brief History</i> surveys the principles behind aboriginal and agricultural fire practices, the characteristics of urban fire, and the relationship between controlled combustion and technology. Pyne describes how fire's role in cities, suburbs, exurbs, and wildlands has been shaped by an industrialized, urban way of thinking. </p><p><i>Fire: A Brief History</i> will be of value to readers interested in the environment from the standpoint of anthropology, geography, forestry, science and technology, history, or the humanities.</p></p><p><p>The essential story of fire by a noted environmental historian</p>Stephen J. Pyne, a noted environmental historian, is a professor in the Biology and Society Program at Arizona State University.

Both the literature of imperialism and its postcolonial aftermath emerge here as a series of guilty transactions between two cultures that are equally evasive and uncertain of their own authority.<br> <br> "A dense, witty, and richly allusive book . . . an extremely valuable contribution to postcolonial cultural studies as well as to the whole area of literary criticism."&#x2014;Jean Sudrann, <i>Choice</i></p></p><p>Author of the memoir Meatless Days ( LJ 4/15/89), Suleri explores the relation of colonial and postcolonial writers to the experience of India. In chapters on Edmund Burke, E.M. Forster, Rudyard Kipling, V.S. Naipaul, and Salman Rushdie, as well as one on 19th-century women diarists, Suleri examines the textual strategies by which the authors confront the experience of Indian culture. While many theorists focus on the theme of an impenetrable "Otherness" in this experience, Suleri is concerned with a sense of identity and self-recognition in the Other. While her prose is occasionally clotted, her insights are compelling, providing a valuable theoretical model for discussing the confrontation of diverse cultures. For academic libraries.<br><i>-T.L.

I believe it would be quite useful for students who are just starting to engage in statistical analysis. I think the strength of the book is definitely its structure &#x2013; which is really good (I teaching the same order) and also the relative simplicity of explanations. I think this is a good BA level book. I also believe international MA students who have not engaged in any quantitative analysis may find it useful. I find the boxes with explanations very helpful and the illustrative pictograms make the statistical concept more visual and understandable. I would not adopt it as a core book for MA, but will include it in a list of suggested readings. The only issue I have is the relevance of the US examples to the British context where I teach. I think the irrelevance of the context might deter students from reading it. &nbsp;I think I will adopt some of the visual ways (boxes and graphs) to represent stats &#x2013; perhaps in my lecture slides.

It focuses on environmental problems associated with land planning, landscape design, and land use. New coverage is included on adaptive planning as an approach necessary to build a sustainable landscape. Greater emphasis is placed on systems and updated case studies are integrated throughout the chapters. This edition also arms the&nbsp;student with a collection of the best management practices, which can be applied in the field.</p><p>"There is a predictable sameness creeping over the face of the North American landscape. Since the early 1970s, highways, shopping centers, residential subdivisions, and most other forms of development have taken on a remarkable similarity from coast to coast...We know that this facade of development masks an inherently diverse landscape...rooted in the varied physiographic and ecological character of the continent and this in turn reflects differences in the way the terrestrial environment functions. Does it not seem reasonable then that development and land use should also reflect these differences if they are to be responsive to the environment?" This authoritative text provides comprehensive coverage on the key methods and techniques involved in environmental planning. The third edition is extensively updated and revised to incorporate the rapid expansions taking place in this field.

In <b>Seeds of Destruction</b>, former Bush chief White House economist R. Glenn Hubbard and well-known CNBC commentator Peter Navarro explain why current economic policy is a catastrophic failure. Then, they offer a comprehensive, bipartisan blueprint for reversing the decline of America's currency, manufacturing base, and standard of living - setting the stage for the epic policy debates that will precede the 2010 elections. Hubbard and Navarro begin with a "checklist" of what it takes to be a prosperous, democratic nation - and show why Obama's policies (some of Bush's also) fail on every level. They explain why the activist Federal Reserve and Obama fiscal stimulus policies are doing far more harm than good... why we must restore the U.S. manufacturing base, whatever China says about it... how to transform tax policy into an engine of growth and innovation... how to apply the "tough love" needed to save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid... why America must resign the job of world policeman... how market-based solutions can finally deliver real energy independence... how to reform our antique financial regulatory system without imposing heavy-handed rules that cause even more trouble.</p></p><p><p>Government policy and the Obama administration are driving the American economy straight toward catastrophe.

By following a strict set of principles &#x2014; including direct treatment of the subject, minimal use of adjectives, precision of language, and the development of an individual rhythmic style &#x2014; the Imagists created dazzling works of gemlike appeal.<br>This volume contains over 180 well-chosen Imagist masterpieces by Erza Pound, D. H. Lawrence, H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), James Joyce, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, and other masters. Its roster of lesser-known poets features Richard Aldington, Walter Conrad Arensberg, Skipworth Cann�ll, Adelaide Crapsey, John Gould Fletcher, and many others.<br>Several of these poems appeared first in books by the represented poets and in the very first Imagist anthologies; others were published in such journals as <i>Poetry</i>, <i>The Dial</i>, <i>The Trend</i>, and <i>The Egoist</i>. Carefully chosen for their individual poetic strengths as well as their characteristic illustration of Imagism, these verses represent the very best of thousands of "imagistic" verses published from 1913 to 1922.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>Bob Blaisdell is professor of English at the City University of New York&#39;s Kingsborough Community College and the editor of twenty-two Dover literature and poetry collections.</p><h2>Empty and Full: the Language of Chinese Painting</h2><p>Chinese painting might be called "philosophy in action," for it is one of the highest expressions of Chinese spirituality. Both a medium for contemplation leading to self-transcendence and a microcosm embodying universal principles and primal forces, it is a means for making manifest the Chinese worldview. At the heart of this worldview is the notion of emptiness, the dynamic principle of transformation. Only through emptiness can things attain their full measure and human beings approach the universe at the level of totality.<br>Focusing on the principle of emptiness, Francois Cheng uses semiotic analysis and textual explication to reveal the key themes and structures of Chinese aesthetics in the practice of pictorial art. Among the many Chinese writers, poets, and artists whose writings are quoted, he gives special emphasis to a great Ch'ing dynasty theoretician and painter, Shih-t'ao. Twenty-seven reproductions of the words of Shih-t'ao and other masters illustrate the interpretive commentary.</p><p>Francois Cheng is a professor at the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations at the University of Paris.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>How Poetry Can Change Your Heart: (Books on Poetry, Creative Writing Books, Books about Reading Poetry) (The HOW Series)</h2><p><b>From the acclaimed "HOW Series" of books</b><br><br><b>Poetry can transform: </b> How can a poem transform a life?

She explains that childbearing women and their physicians gradually changed birth places because they believed the increased medicalization would make giving birth safer and more comfortable. Ironically, because of infection, infant and maternal mortality did not immediately decline. She concludes that birthing women held considerable power in determining labor and delivery events as long as childbirth remained in the home. The move to the hospital in the twentieth century gave the medical profession the upper hand. Leavitt also discusses recent events in American obstetrics that illustrate how women have attempted to retrieve some of the traditional women--and family--centered aspects of childbirth.<br></p><p><br><strong>Judith Walzer Leavitt</strong> is Professor of History of Medicine and Women's Studies at the University of Wisconsin.

For that purpose, it uses authentic readings especially compiled for the purpose drawn largely from Theravada canonical works, both prose and poetry. The reading are in Roman script, and carefully graded for difficulty, but they have also been selected so that each of them is a meaningful and complete reading in itself, so as to introduce some basic concepts and ways of thought of Theravada Buddhism. This book thus offers and opportunity to become acquainted with the ways in which the teachings of the Buddha are embodied in the language, a sense that it impossible to determine from English translations. The book contains 12 lessons. Each of them has three parts: (1) a set of basic readings and an accompanying glossary, (2) grammatical notes on the forms in the less, and (3) a set of further readings with its own glossary. The further readings introduce no new grammatical points, but reinforce ones already presented and give further practice in them. The work concludes, fittingly, with the Buddha s first sermon, The Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta. A cumulative glossary and index to the grammar is also provided. <br><br> The text has been used successfully in its preliminary form at several universities, but it may also be used for self-study.</p><p>Text: English</p><h2>The Brain: All about Our Nervous System and More!

The text is reprinted here with the previously unpublished preface Moore wrote for a planned, but never completed, second edition. Though unfinished, it sets out clearly Moore&#39;s second thoughts about his own work. The volume also includes two important pieces from his later ethical writings, &#34;Free Will&#34; and &#34;The Conception of Intrinsic Value,&#34; and a new introduction by Thomas Baldwin.</p><p>It took us thousands of years of struggling with science and ethics before we thought to combine the two. While scientific ethics has advanced only gradually, the science <i>of</i> ethics burst into existence in 1903 with the publication of G.E. Moore's <i>Principia Ethica</i>, which did for the study of morality what Whitehead and Russell's <i>Principia Mathematica</i> did for mathematics--clarify old confusions and define terms that are still with us today. Practically overnight, ethicists turned into meta-ethicists, studying their own terms to establish theoretical ground on which to stand before trying to build any prescriptive edifices.<p> Moore begins by clearing up some of the most widely spread confusions plaguing moral philosophy, such as the naturalistic fallacy of Bentham, Spencer, and others who insisted on a precise, concrete definition of <i>good</i>. According to Moore, we have to settle for an intuitive assessment of goodness, and his arguments are powerfully compelling. Proceeding to define terms and territory that have lasted a century, he revolutionized philosophy and single-handedly altered the course of ethical studies for generations. While <i>Principia Ethica</i> isn't the easiest book to read (a dictionary of philosophy comes in handy for most of us), it is well worth careful study by anyone interested in the difference between right and wrong. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Recognized as the definitive starting point for twentieth-century ethical theory, the text is reprinted with the previously unpublished preface Moore wrote for a planned, but never completed, second edition. &#34;Free Will&#34; and &#34;The Conception of Intrinsic Value&#34; are also included from his later ethical writings.</p><h2>Modern Operating Systems (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p> The widely anticipated revision of this worldwide best-seller incorporates the latest developments in operating systems technologies.&nbsp; The Third Edition includes up-to-date materials on relevant operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and embedded real-time and multimedia systems.

Since 1962, Dr. Huggins has practiced general dentistry with an emphasis on nutrition. In 1973, he became involved in the study of mercury toxicity and its impact on human health. Through the course of his investigation of the mechanisms of toxicity as they relate to autoimmune diseases, Dr. Huggins earned a master of science from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.<br><br>In 1983, he began a full-time practice devoted to diagnosing and planning treatment for patients suffering from mercury toxicity. He is currently a consultant worldwide for multi-disciplined centers and founder of the Multi-Discipline Alliance of professionals who practice the Huggins Protocol for recovery from autoimmune diseases.<b>Introduction</b><p>How many people are really affected by the metals in their fillings? This is the question I am asked most frequently, and it is the question I wrestled with for the first decade that I investigated the topic of toxicity. In 1984, the American Dental Association (ADA) stated in Science Digest that only 5 percent of the population was sensitive, and that that was too low to be significant. Someone (maybe I) pointed out that, according to statistics of epidemiology, in some cases 5 percent is considered an epidemic. If 5 percent of the population had polio or AIDS, that would be over 12 million people in the United States alone. Would that be considered insignificant by anybody other than the ADA? Strange as it seems, by the next month there were apparently many more healthy people in the United States; a new statement from the ADA showed that only 1 percent was sensitive. By 1989, that figure had dropped to one in 1 million; in 1991, it was back up to 3 percent. I can find no studies to support any of these claims, however, so I wonder how scientific they really are. My frustration involved trying to find some way to determine this other than reading hopeful opinions.</p><p>In search of the answer to this question, in 1983, I developed a patch test for mercury toxicity. A patch test involves applying a suspect substance to the skin on a small surgical pad, and observing the reaction. If the skin turns red, the patient is said to have a sensitivity to the substance. It didn&#x2019;t take long to find that a change in skin color was not the prime indicator that it was made out to be, however, because skin reactions are the result of allergic responses, not toxic reactions.</p><p>In working with the patch test, I found only 33 percent of the 1,000 people tested actually turned red at the site of the patch. But systemic reactions were demonstrated by 90 percent of those tested. The term systemic refers to an internal body reaction, rather than an external reaction like a skin rash. Systemic diseases include kidney disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes, and arthritis. The systemic reactions I observed included significant changes in blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature. Since only slightly more than one-third of the reactive people actually got a red skin reaction, I concluded that the patch was not a very valid test.</p><p>The reason I stopped using the patch was that whatever people&#x2019;s problems were, when the patch was placed, they were apt to have a double-plus reaction in that specific area. For example, if mercury toxicity was suspected because a patient was having seizures, a patch was apt to set off seizure activity after a few hours. Migraines could be triggered, emotional upheavals generated, loss of muscle control similar to the symptoms of MS begun&#x2014;enough negatives to suggest that there had to be a better way to test people, preferably something done in a test tube. I did note that my finding of 90 percent actual reactivity was far different from the ADA&#x2019;s 5 percent, 1 percent, 3 percent, or one in 1 million.</p><p>In 1985, at age 48, plagued by not finding answers, I went to the University of Colorado and asked Douglas Swartzendruber, Ph.D., if I could audit one of his courses in immunology. He said no, and that if I really wanted to learn something about immunology, I would have to take the prescribed courses, complete with exams. I was 52 when I obtained my Master of Science degree. My thesis, on mercury toxicity, was entitled &#x201c;The Medical and Legal Implications of Components of Dental Materials.&#x201d; Those implications were astounding&#x2014;but not as astounding as the active avoidance of confrontation of the problem by the leaders of the dental profession.</p><p>How many people are really affected by mercury toxicity? While I was at the university, I began a study that evolved into a full-blown examination of immune reactivity to all of the dental components I could find. I use the term &#x201c;find&#x201d; advisedly, because most dental manufacturers are reluctant to let anyone know just what chemicals are in their patented materials. Many eventually became cooperative&#x2014;after I signed nondisclosure agreements, and mentioned that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says that we as dentists have to inform our patients of the composition of the products. In other words, if I go to jail for not informing patients, you, Mr. Manufacturer, are going to be my cellmate.</p><p>My first immune tests were a light-year ahead of the selection technique most dentists are taught in school, which is to &#x201c;use whatever works best in your hands.&#x201d; I soon found that immunology offers many refinements if you want to look long enough and to pay enough for equipment. The most recent results of double-blind tests on over 3,500 patients shed the following light on immune reactivity of amalgam components: 95.29 percent were reactive to copper; 94.04 percent to zinc; 90.2 percent to mercury; 66.86 percent to silver; and 62.51 percent to tin.</p><p>It&#x2019;s interesting to note that the original patch tests showed 90 percent of the people to be reactive to mercury, and this test showed 90.2 percent. The important thing was that now there was a test that did not adversely affect patients, and that I could now test for nearly 100 dental chemicals other than mercury. This led me to find that there were many replacement dental materials that also had a negative impact on the human immune system. It is easy to jump from the frying pan into the fire, so don&#x2019;t just run out and replace your amalgams. I will tell you more about this in Chapter 5.</p><p>So 90.2 percent of us are reactive to mercury. So what? What is mercury toxicity anyway? What sort of reaction should we expect? Herein lies the sinister part of the problem. Not everyone reacts in the same way. If we all caught a cold when we were exposed to mercury, amalgam would have been banned decades ago. On a really basic level, the ways in which mercury attacks the body can be identified in five categories. The fifth one, miscellaneous, is actually the largest. The categories are: neurological, cardiovascular, collagen, immunological, and miscellaneous. To break these down further into the potential symptoms and the percentages of the population that experience these symptoms, following are the results of a study of 1,320 patients from whom I extracted (no pun intended) the following data.</p><p>Neurological problems encompass two divisions, motor and sensory. An example of motor problems would be tremors, while sensory might be brainfog (spaciness), short-term memory problems, or depression. The percentages of patients exhibiting these mercury-caused problems are: depression, 73.3 percent; numb fingers or toes, 67.3 percent; memory problems, 58.0 percent; frequent leg cramps, 49.1 percent; facial twitches, 52.3 percent; and jitteriness or nervousness, 38.1 percent.</p><p>As with many aspects of mercury toxicity, the term &#x201c;unexplained&#x201d; precedes the names of specific mercury-induced cardiovascular symptoms. Heart attacks have a specific cause. Mercury-caused problems are elusive. The percentages I have found are: unexplained chest pains, 35.6 percent, and unexplained tachycardia, 32.4 percent.</p><p>The most common problem in the collagen category is arthritis. Constant or frequent pain in the joints constitutes 35.5 percent of the symptoms in this category.</p><p>Immunological disorders are probably the most significant category, as shown by studies done in my laboratory on over 3,500 people. Over 90 percent of these people demonstrated immune reactivity. This is most often seen in what are called autoimmune diseases, or diseases in which the body&#x2019;s immune system attacks its own tissues. Briefly, when an atom of mercury embeds itself in a cell, the cell looks different to your immune system, and the immune cells are told to kill off that unusual-looking cell. The instances of these diseases are expanding exponentially, and, according to my observations, the combination of the new, high-copper amalgams and root canals are primary causative factors. Examples of autoimmune diseases include MS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease), lupus erythematosus, diabetes, certain types of arthritis, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>The miscellaneous category gets crowded. Some of the symptoms include: frequent urination, 64.5 percent; chronic fatigue, 63.1 percent; bloated feeling after eating, 60.6 percent; recurring constipation, 54.6 percent; ringing in the ears, 47.8 percent; metallic taste in the mouth, 38.7 percent; suicidal thoughts, 37.3 percent; and headaches after eating, 20.1 percent. The miscellaneous category also includes allergies. Many of today&#x2019;s food and airborne allergies seem to show a correlation between placement of fillings and the onset of these allergies. With allergies, just removing the offending fillings, unfortunately, does not bring about an alleviation of symptoms. In Chapters 7, 8, and 9, I will talk about the steps a recovering mercury-toxic patient must take to allay and eliminate symptoms.</p><p>How does one go about identifying mercury toxicity? Is there a test that positively says you are mercury toxic? Not yet, but we are on the brink of finding one. Meanwhile, there are many things we can identify that happen to a person&#x2019;s blood chemistry when he or she is reacting to mercury. Although these changes can occur in a variety of other conditions, when they occur in conjunction with certain symptoms, one can assemble the parts and end up with a diagnosis.</p><p>White blood cells are quite sensitive to the presence of components of amalgam&#x2014;not just mercury, but also copper and zinc. In response to the placement of amalgam, white cells usually go up initially. Then the differential, or the populations of different types of white cells, moves around in a characteristic fashion. Blood proteins, blood sugar, cholesterol, red blood cells, oxyhemoglobin, and liver enzymes can all do little jigs when exposed to heavy metals. Standard tests (and many more of the sophisticated immune tests) show that all of these components have tendencies to make unexplained moves when exposures occur to sensitized people. Heredity plays a definite role in this, for if a person is not genetically predisposed to develop a certain disease, all the environmental exposure in the world will not create that disease.</p><p>Obviously, it takes a lot of training and experience to ferret out the grains of diagnosis from the chaff of interfering chemistry. Treatment is a subject that expands every month or two. There are so many areas affected by heavy metals that I don&#x2019;t know if we will ever find them all.</p><p>In the following chapters, you will learn about the history of mercury toxicity, diseases caused by mercury toxicity, testing procedures, and my treatment plan, complete with nutritional guidelines. After reading this book, you will have a good understanding of the depth of the mercury problem. May this book provide hope to those of you who have been told for so long that your problems are &#x201c;all in your head.&#x201d;</p><p><b>1<br>Amalgam and Its Potential for Destruction</b></p><p>In 1984, the American Dental Association (ADA), with no scientific proof, announced that 5 percent of the population (12.5 million people in the United States), was reactive to mercury and that that was insignificant. When I mentioned that 5 percent was considered epidemic by some standards, they soon changed that figure to 1 percent. I have now tested a total of over 7,000 patients, and I can show that over 90 percent of them demonstrate immune reactivity to low levels of mercury; thus the credibility battle between organizational prestige and actual tests on patients. The ADA can&#x2019;t lose. Neither can I. The only loser is you, the patient, who unsuspectingly allow toxic mercury materials to be placed in your mouth by dentists, who have been told by the ADA that amalgam&#x2014;the generic term for silver-mercury fillings that actually contain 50 percent mercury&#x2014;is safe.</p><p><b>TWO AMALGAM STORIES</b></p><p>This is the story of my first encounter with a mercury-toxic patient:</p><p>Jan had had a thirty-minute appointment, which was not too bad since she had not had a cavity in five years. While the dentist was working on her teeth, she suddenly experienced a shooting pain in her chest and a quick short intake of breath. She wanted to hold it until the pain went away. As her eyes began to grow wider and perspiration stood out on her forehead, the dentist asked something like, &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t all right,&#x201d; Jan told me later, &#x201c;but I didn&#x2019;t know what was wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; she remembered the dentist saying. &#x201c;You are just uptight about being at the dentist&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been frightened before,&#x201d; she complained. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the pain in my chest. It&#x2019;s awful.&#x201d;</p><p>She said the dentist told her she would be fine, &#x201c;but the words came out of a soft cloud somewhere that surrounded me and all that was around me.</p><p>&#x201c;I decided to be brave and endure&#x2014;not the dentist, but the awful pain in my chest,&#x201d; Jan said. &#x201c;I squirmed slightly in the chair and heard a whisper telling me that it couldn&#x2019;t possibly hurt, because he was through. I felt that I was all through, too. I wanted to close my eyes and drift off. Maybe that would stop the pain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I remember seeing Jan wander into the reception room where I was waiting for her,&#x201d; her mother said. &#x201c;She had a glazed, but pained, look on her face. When I asked what was wrong, she just clutched my arm and said that she wanted to go home. The intensity of her grasp told me that I had better do just that. I sensed that a few tiny fillings could not be causing this kind of reaction, but perhaps her period was about to start and she was feeling dizzy.</p><p>&#x201c;I glanced at the receptionist, but she was busy answering a telephone, and didn&#x2019;t seem concerned about Jan, so I brushed dentistry aside and took Jan to the car. She got into the back seat and lay down, saying something about her chest. Nothing made sense, but I took her home.&#x201d;</p><p>That night, Jan&#x2019;s mother rushed her to the emergency room of a nearby hospital. She now knew what hyperventilation was. Jan had calmed down after getting home, but then another severe pain had hit her in the chest.</p><p>&#x201c;Mommy, I&#x2019;m going to die,&#x201d; she kept reciting. Her mother had believed her, as I believed her now, while I watched this scenario that I had heard her mother tell me about over the phone. I watched as Jan quivered and cried tearless sobs, looking up from a terribly acne-pocked face. &#x201c;Do something, please,&#x201d; Jan pleaded with me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fading.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She never had the acne before the fillings either,&#x201d; her mother was saying. I wondered incredulously, She&#x2019;s worried about acne while her daughter is dying in front of our eyes? Obviously her mother had seen this reaction often and knew that Jan was not in fact going to die. I decided to take the cue, and to do something scientific instead of standing there paralyzed by the demonstration her mother thought I should witness. I drew Jan&#x2019;s blood. That was the one thing I knew something about. Perhaps the blood would tell me the secret of these recurring spells.</p><p>&#x201c;What did they tell you at the hospital?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Which time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How many times has she been to the hospital?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dozens. I figured if I told you tha...</p></p>
